22 hbo 's subscription streaming service will be called hbo now and is expected to cost <number> per month according to the international business times the report says that hbo is targeting a launch for now in early april ahead of the start date for game of thrones while game of thrones would be a great way for hbo to drive subscriptions to the new service it 'll have to be careful if it plans to do that last year hbo 's online streaming option for cable subscribers hbo go would n't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere that would be a very bad look for a new service and the times says that hbo does n't plan on launching until it 's satisfied that it can do so without issue
22 <number>month would make hbo 's service nearly twice the cost of netflix
22 apple is reportedly one of the partners that hbo could launch its new service with according to the times apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of hbo 's launch partners if a deal is made apple tv users would be able to access and stream hbo now potentially through a standalone app apple has been adding more and more channels to the apple tv over the last couple years and the addition of hbo 's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing the times notes that hbo 's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the roku xbox and playstation as well but it 's not clear if discussions are ongoing nonetheless it seems likely that hbo would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there
22 it 's still not known what hbo 's subscription streaming service will actually offer though many will hope for the same access that hbo go receives that is all of hbo 's original content and the movies it 's currently playing it 's possible that wo n't be the case hbo may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online on the other hand the <number> per month fee may mean that hbo is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe that price would make it tougher to compete with netflix but hbo has n't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past with the even wider audience that this service will open it up to hbo may not be that worried

47 after campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk mayor bill de blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy law-enforcement officials tell the new york times that soon the nypd may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests under the de blasio administration 's planned changes to the city 's marijuana policy those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons but avoid a trip to the police station the shift could have a huge impact in black and latino communities as a recent study found those groups represented <number> percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year
47 the de blasio administration is still working out the details such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest and some are already unhappy with the proposed change brooklyn district attorney kenneth thompson who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities
47 in order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review thompson explained by allowing these cases to avoid early review by issuing a summons there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place these cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred
47 in other words do n't expect the debate about how nypd officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon

108 washington  homeland security secretary jeh johnson shot down claims on thursday that a porous us southern border is allowing terrorists ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country despite claims to the contrary by some politicians
108 johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the center for strategic and international studies saying there have been improvements to border security he said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year <number> was <number>  considerably lower than a projection of <number> claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false he said and the government is intensifying efforts to keep ebola out of the us
108 but that 's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news he said
108 those of us in public office and in the media  whether in describing the border isil or ebola  owe the public informed careful and responsible dialogue not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear anxiety and suspicion johnson said isil the terrorist group that calls itself the islamic state also is called isis

108 johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the kurdish worker 's party which he said is actually fighting against isil and defended kurdish territory in iraq the men remain in detention for unlawful entry he said chaffetz for his part continued to maintain after johnson 's speech that the men are terrorists according to interview with cbs news
108 on ebola johnson said the government is heavily engaged and is enhancing our ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected african countries and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate
108 we very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the ebola virus he said
108 johnson touted border security improvements but said dhs was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination one change in dhs policy however has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates the increased practice of holding families in detention the government has expanded facilities for detaining families  largely mothers with children many of them seeking asylum  over the past few months and plans to add more space

117 reasons cited for his mysterious disappearance range from ill health through an addiction to cheese to him being placed under house arrest now the latest explanation for kim jong un 's conspicuous absence is that he has simply injured his leg a source with access to the secretive north 's leadership today insisted the leader is in firm control of his government playing down speculation over the <number>-year-old 's health and grip on power north korea 's state media which usually chronicles kim 's whereabouts in great detail has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on september <number> the source said that kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises he is un-well the north korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals a source with access to the dictatorship has said playing down speculation over the <number>-year-old 's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest
117 he is un-well the north korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals a source with access to the dictatorship has said playing down speculation over the <number>-year-old 's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest he ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too they were crawling and running and rolling around and he pulled a tendon  the source told reuters on condition of anonymity he injured his ankle and knee around late august or early september while drilling because he is overweight he limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened  the source said
117 kim who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in <number> had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in july which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury kim needs about <number> days to recuperate said the source whose information could not be independently verified kim jong un is in total control  said the source who has close ties to pyongyang and beijing
117 friday is the <number>th anniversary of the founding of north korea 's workers  party an event kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred if kim does not turn up it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle experts said the longer he remains out of the public eye the more uncertainty about him and the status of his regime will grow  said curtis melvin a researcher at the us-korea institute at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies in washington north korean officials have denied that kim 's public absence since early september is health-related and a us official following north korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble it remains unclear why a leg injury would keep kim out of the public eye for so long although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view
117 in june <number> six months after coming to power state media failed to report on or photograph him for <number> days he re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium speculation that kim 's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a north korean tv report late last month that said he was suffering from discomfort some pyongyang watchers also suggest that kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the asian games in incheon south korea another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in pyongyang the source with knowledge of kim jong un 's health said rumours of a coup were rubbish it would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans  said andray abrahamian of the choson exchange a singapore-based ngo running a programme for north koreans in southeast asia north korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling kim family kim 's sister kim yo jong is known to have an official role within the ruling party his brother kim jong chol and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye kim was absent from a sept <number> meeting of the supreme people 's assembly or parliament the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago however kim 's name has not disappeared from state propaganda thursday 's edition of the workers  party newspaper the rodong sinmun carried three letters to kim from overseas allies on its front page and has reported on returning athletes from the asian games who thanked the marshal  for his support during the competition abrahamian said it was unlikely kim had been usurped kim jong un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted it is unlikely that they would want to remove him given his unmatchable symbolic value again though everyone is guessing  he said

121 claim deandre joshua was murdered after testifying before a grand jury in ferguson
121 false
121 example collected via email december <number>
121 deandre joshua <number> was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson mo case supposedly he was found not far from where brown 's body was he was covered in lighter fluid it was a post i saw on fb just wondered if it was true
121 origins shortly after a <number>-year-old man named deandre joshua was killed in ferguson missouri on <number> november <number> rumors started circulating around the internet connecting the young man 's murder to the non-indictment of officer darren wilson in the controversial shooting death of michael brown
121 the details of joshua 's death are gruesome according to the washington post deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car the incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of ferguson to protest the grand jury 's decision not to indict darren wilson these circumstances coupled with the fact that joshua was a friend of dorian johnson who was with mike brown on the night of his death led many to believe joshua 's murder was in some way connected to wilson 's non-indictment
121 this is deandre joshua this <number> year old man testified in the grand jury case against darren wilson he was shot and killed on tuesday his body was found with lighter fluid all over it not far from where darren wilson killed michael brown why are broken windows on the front page of our news and not his face
121 however there is no documentation deandre joshua testified before the grand jury according to the boston globe names of the witnesses were kept secret and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge additionally joshua 's family and friends told the new york times he was nowhere near the scene when mike brown was shot and killed and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness
121 according to family members friends and law-enforcement officials however joshua was nowhere near canfield drive when brown was killed during a confrontation with wilson on aug <number> and could n't have witnessed the shooting and mcculloch 's office which remained tight-lipped about the wilson investigation confirmed that joshua did n't offer testimony during the proceedings

130 social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of fidel castro 's death but there was no sign friday that the reports were true even if the <number>-year-old former cuban leader has not been seen in public for months
130 similar speculation has swept across cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in <number> handing over leadership to his younger brother raul

146 us drones are being flown over isil 's syrian capital for the first time as part of a drive by america to target abu bakr al-baghdadi the jihadist group 's elusive leader
146 residents of the northern syrian city of raqqa have captured photo and video footage of remotely-piloted planes which western weapons experts have identified as american predators the same drones used in pakistan and yemen to attack suspected terrorists
146 the us has not publicly stated that it is flying drones over syria and the sightings over raqqa are the first indication that it is doing so
146 the sightings are the clearest indication that president barack obama has dramatically changed his policy aggressively stepping up reconnaissance of isil positions as the us works to assemble an international coalition to fight the jihadists
146 that diplomatic effort was given a major boost on monday when iraq 's parliament finally voted to approve a new government aimed at winning broad support against isil with haider al-abadi as prime minister
146 mr abadi a member of iraq 's shia majority whose candidacy was supported by the us and other western powers had promised to include members of the sunni minority as well as kurds within his government the attempt to heal sectarian rifts is seen as vital to undermining isil 's appeal in the sunni heartlands where disaffection with the previous shia-dominated government assisted the extremist islamist group in its rise
146 mr obama immediately called haider al-abadi the new prime minister and urged him to move quickly to address the legitimate grievances of iraq 's disenchanted sunnis
146 john kerry the us secretary of state said the formation of the unity government was a major milestone for iraq
146 mps in baghdad also voted to approve three senior figures in the largely ceremonial role of deputy presidents nouri al-maliki ousted as prime minister in july osama al-nujeifi a sunni and former parliament speaker and iyad allawi a secular shia politician who refused to join the last government

147 olsen had questioned the nike ball with which woods plays too saying i would almost bet hadnt been tested so hes really playing with im not gon na say a cheater ball because he has the help of the establishment really but he played a ball that nobody else could play so that combined with his enhancement issues like having a canadian blood spinning doctor in his phone you know i mean i think people are starting to openly call it what it is which is gon na be a problem for him

155 conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges bills sometimes did n't show up and he was charged for equipment that was never activated or that he did n't actually have customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved instead things got significantly more hellish in october of last year
155 according to conal comcast sent him nearly <number> of equipment he 'd never ordered and did n't want and tried to bill him for it anyway

155 even then conal says he was n't able to get his money back instead comcast sent him to collections in february
155 and this is where conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job per consumerist
155 on feb <number> <number> he chose to try going above comcast 's customer service which had n't been of any help in the year he 'd been a subscriber and instead contacted the office of the company 's controller he spoke to someone in that office who promised conal would receive a call back to address the issues
155 he describes that callback as bizarre with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from just starting out with how can i help you then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment but would n't specify which appointment the rep then began asking him for the color of his house
155 so he tried the controller 's office again to let them know that the rep they 'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job

158 hundreds of palestinians were evacuated from their homes sunday morning after israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border flooding the gaza valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm
158 the gaza ministry of interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the ministry of public works had evacuated more than <number> families from both sides of the gaza valley wadi gaza after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters
158 gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down
158 the storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands including many of the approximately <number> palestinians left homeless by israel 's assault over summer
158 the suffering is compounded by the fact that israel has maintained a complete siege over gaza for the last eight years severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators it has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes as construction materials are largely banned from entering
158 gaza civil defense services spokesman muhammad al-midana warned that further harm could be caused if israel opens up more dams in the area noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the israel border through the valley and into the mediterranean sea
158 evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by unrwa the un agency for palestinian refugees in al-bureij refugee camp and in al-zahra neighborhood in the central gaza strip
158 the gaza valley wadi gaza is a wetland located in the central gaza strip between al-nuseirat refugee camp and al-moghraqa it is called habesor in hebrew and it flows from two streams  one whose source runs from near beersheba and the other from near hebron
158 israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside gaza and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area

168 get ready for the tech press to flip out when apple announces the retail price for the gold apple watch edition model apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers but the <number>-karat gold apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of <number> the funny thing in this case is that apple is perfectly right to be charging that much
168 do you disagree check out my counterpoint the case against the <number> gold apple watch edition
168 gold is expensive
168 lets start with a little backgrounder in gold everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive even rabid internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news but most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is so this is a good place to begin the discussion
168 update my calculations were wrong also this was a bit back of the envelope now that it has some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic
168 here are the basic facts
168 gold currently sells for between <number> and <number> per troy ounce and has been over <number> per troy ounce for the last five years <number>-karat gold contains <number> pure gold and that term is regulated by law one ounce of <number>k gold occupies about <number> cubic centimeters of volume since a typical <number>-karat gold alloy weighs about <number> grams per cc <number>-karat gold currently sells for <number> per gram <number> per troy ounce or <number> per cc <number> cc of <number>k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and <number> cc gets you a deployant clasp it takes a few more to build a watch case anywhere from <number> to <number> cc depending on the size and thickness of the case so the buckle is worth <number>-<number> and the watch case <number> to <number> just as raw gold this is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than <number>
168 gold watches are expensive
168 lets apply this to a watch case imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case <number> mm high by <number> mm wide by <number> mm deep if it was solid this would equal <number> cc of volume but its a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back etc so lets just leave <number> mm of thickness all around making a hollow rectangle this equals <number> cc <number> x <number> x <number> <number> x <number> x <number> therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost <number> as of this writing

171 washington a us republican senator and frequent mideast traveler said thursday that the taliban detainees released from guantanamo bay in exchange for sgt bowe bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-qaida linked haqqani network yet all five still are being monitored in qatar
171 the pentagon said thursday that it is working with qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated
171 sen lindsey graham who recently visited qatar said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small gulf nation
171 qatar gained public praise from president barack obama for brokering the controversial deal in may <number> that freed army sgt bowe bergdahl from taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the us-run guantanamo bay prison in cuba
171 qatar promised obama it would keep the five under watch for one year although they would then be free to leave
171 it 's just a year deal graham told the associated press on wednesday just as sure as we 're sitting here they 're going back to the fight
171 they ve had some haqqani people come to meet with them they 're reaching out the taliban five are communicating with people inside afghanistan

173 nicaraguan officials have appealed for witnesses to a meteorite strike that left a <number>m-wide crater near managua 's international airport on saturday night
173 residents reported a loud boom as the meteorite crashed but scientists said no one had come forward who had seen the streak that a speeding space rock would score across the sky
173 i was sitting on my porch and i saw nothing then all of a sudden i heard a large blast jorge santamaria told the associated press we thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave
173 a government spokeswoman rosario murillo said a team formed to study the event believed the <number>m-deep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to earth she said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation
173 the meteorite may have been a fragment of a house-sized asteroid nicknamed pitbull which hurtled past earth on sunday night at a distance of <number>km
173 dan brown an astronomer at nottingham trent university said that although the nicaraguan impact occurred <number> hours before pitbull passed earth central america was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid
173 pieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun
173 it certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom but a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that brown said
173 humberto saballos a volcanologist with the nicaraguan institute of territorial studies told the ap it was unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or was buried on impact at the site the meteorite could have exploded in the air and produced a shockwave that made the crater or struck the ground and left small fragments embedded in the soil

175 moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred if they do so he promised they would experience a strange floating sensation

200 breitbart texas reports
200 an islamic tribunal using sharia law in texas has been confirmed by breitbart texas the tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in dallas one of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunals decisions are voluntary
200 breitbart texas spoke with one of the judges dr taher el-badawi he said the tribunal operates under sharia law as a form of non-binding dispute resolution el-badawi said their organization is a tribunal not arbitration a tribunal is defined by meriam-websters dictionary as a court or forum of justice the four islamic attorneys call themselves judges not arbitrators
200 el-badawi said the tribunal follows sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters he said they also resolve workplace disputes
200 in matters of divorce el-badawi said that while participation in the tribunal is voluntary a married couple can not be considered divorced by the islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal he compared their divorce known as talaq as something similar to the catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage
200 an examinercom article seems troubled by this
200 this though is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in america el-badawi is right that catholics have long gone to catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage orthodox jews have long gone to jewish religious courts such a court is called a beth din both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes some protestants sometimes do the same <number> corinthians <number> is often interpreted as calling for that
200 there are three ways in which these tribunals decisions have practical effect
200 <number> parties respect for the system religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious law for instance a catholic who doesnt get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment simply because he feels that god wants him to follow the churchs teachings and decisions

209 when us president barack obama agreed in may to exchange five taliban detainees from guantanamo bay for bowe bergdahl a us soldier who had been held captive for five years his political opponents had a field day they warned that the detainees risked returning to afghanistan and to militancy obama with the backing of the government of qatar that had agreed to host the men promised that they would be kept far from the battlefield seems that the men may have had other ideas according to cnn us military and intelligence officials now suspect that at least one of the detainees has made contact with taliban associates in afghanistan suggesting that he and perhaps the others may be planning a return
209 considering that <number> percent of all us detainees who were held in the guantanamo detention center are either suspected of or confirmed to have returned to the fight according to a march <number> assessment by the office of the director of national intelligence it shouldnt be all that surprising times massimo calabresi predicted as much back in june just after bergdahl was released the recidivism rate he wrote suggests that statistically at least one of the taliban leaders will return to the field to fight americans in afghanistan or elsewhere
209 at the time of the exchange taliban commanders who had been involved in bergdahls capture captivity and release told time that the exchange five of theirs for one of americas would encourage them to seek out more pows so far that hasnt happened its not clear which of the five former detainees was reaching out to associates in afghanistan but as high-ranking commanders and former comrades-in-arms of taliban leader mullah omar any one of them could galvanize a movement that is slowly making gains in the wake of the us drawdown in afghanistan even if those plans have now been foiled the incident may have one other far reaching consequence as obama attempts to close down guantanamo for good his opponents now have more ammunition for why he should not

226 somali president hassan sheikh mohamud urged al-shabab militants to renounce violence saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following godane 's death

227 nigeria 's armed forces chief air chief marshal alex badeh announced the ceasefire on friday to enable the release of the girls who were abducted from the remote northeastern village of chibok in april
227 but boko haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least five attacks since blamed by security sources on the insurgents that have killed dozens talks were scheduled to continue in neighboring chad on monday
227 we were jubilating we had every reason to be happy but since then the ceasefire has been broken in quite a number of places already lawan abana a parent of the one of the missing girls told reuters by telephone
227 he added that there were doubts about the credentials of the reported boko haram negotiator danladi ahmadu who was unheard of before can we trust him that he can deliver on this promise of releasing the girls when he has not delivered on the promise of the ceasefire abana said
227 the government says the attacks may not have been boko haram but one of several criminal groups exploiting the chaos of its insurgency analysts point out that boko haram is anyway heavily factionalized so what matters is whether the faction the government is talking to has control over the girls  fate

228 sex-selecting abortions are nothing new they happen all the time in china for example while they undoubtedly happen in the united states people dont brag about them at least they didnt
228 its hard to believe this is real but according to the website injustice stories a woman named lana a self-described feminist boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy then after making that declaration claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that
228 lana who only uses her first name appears to be a child of privilege she boasts of involvement in fighting for womens rights being all-consuming even to the point of eschewing a career yet that lack of a career hasnt stopped her from travelling to many different places to continue that fight
228 she tells the story of a flight to an occupy wall street event in san francisco where she screamed assault because the man sitting next to her said b like you need to learn their place
228 putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside lana then demanded to be moved to another seat thats when she was told the only empty seats were both back in economy at which point she demanded the man be moved
228 when the flight attendants came running one of whom was male they refused to force the man to move because he hadnt done anything lana regretfully relented and in tears moved herself
228 the encounter left her having felt as though i had been verbally and emotionally raped
228 that flight according to lana left her forever changed by the time we landed my outlook had changed i could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause she wrote
228 lana was pregnant at the time and thought she had a good idea who the father or as she puts it the donator happened to be she was convinced she was having a girl because well she wanted a girl or at least a baby with a vagina the gender part would be up to the child i had already started buying gender neutral clothing since i did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become she writes

232 apple will offer a low power mode on apple watch to help boost it through longer days according to a new report that also takes a stab at dispelling rumors that the company may have elected to all some long-rumored sensors last minute
232 with the exception of pebble products most current and upcoming smartwatches  including the apple watch  will last no more than a day on a single charge to help mitigate this issue apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the apple watch called power reserve according to the new york times it 's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time helping to extend the watch 's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible the function is similar in concept to the battery saver mode in android <number> which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use
232 apple previously stated that the watch 's battery should last only a normal day requiring a fresh charge at night although standard among smartwatches the issue has created controversy since many had been hoping apple would solve the smartwatch industry 's battery woes with its inaugural effort
232 the report also notes that despite some recent claims to the contrary apple 's decision to abandon some advanced health tracking features came over <number> months ago rather than at the last minute early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable instead the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors once again mirroring some competing smartwatches
232 the times also highlights some of the challenges that faced the apple watch 's development cycle noting that apple not only encountered technical difficulties in achieving its ideal design but was also forced to battle the loss of key engineers some of whom were poached by google-owned home automation outfit nest labs among them was bryan james who became an engineering vice president at nest early last year
232 chief among some of the later challenges was keeping a tight lid on secrecy surrounding the product while simultaneously deploying evaluation units into the real world for which apple engineers created dummy casing including some resembling samsung smartwatches
232 apple is due to reveal more details about the watch at a san francisco press event on march <number>th appleinsider will be offering live coverage of the event as it progresses
234 christian bale will not be playing steve jobs in the upcoming movie about the apple co-founder hollywood reporter reports
234 sources say the actor decided he was n't right for the role and withdrew
234 this is coming after the movie 's scriptwriter aaron sorkin confirmed that bale would be playing the prickly tech icon saying the actor did n't even need to audition
234 no word if this 'll affect seth rogan 's negotiations to play steve wozniak but this throws a huge wrinkle into the danny boyle-helmed adaptation of walter isaacson 's critically acclaimed biography of jobs if they get desperate to bring ashton kutcher back into the turtleneck we 'll know things have taken a dark turn
234 who would you rather see play jobs i liked bale for the role but my backup choice is stanley tucci if they can age him down somehow for younger scenes or bradley cooper who has the right kind of nervous energy to spit out sorkin 's rapid dialogue via hollywood reporter

244 a catholic priest from massachusetts had been dead for <number> minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated however it is his description about god that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty
244 father john michael oneal was officially declared dead for more than <number> minutes but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart according to the <number>-year-old man of god the supreme entity isnt a man as is popularly assumed and believed father oneal claims he met god during the brief time he was officially dead and god is a woman
244 the catholic father claims god is a warm and comforting motherly figure the revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of christianity which firmly believes and even implies that god is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion though the love and devotion part is corroborated by father oneal he differs from the churchs teachings about the gender of god
244 father john micheal oneal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack however father oneal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival not one to give up hope so easily doctors at massachusetts general hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called lucas <number>
244 while the blood flowed with the help of modern science doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm consistent with near-death experiences father oneal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered god however instead of the all-mighty father figure the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure father oneal describes the divine entity as mother-like being of light 
244 her presence was both overwhelming and comforting she had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mothers embrace the fact that god is a holy mother instead of a holy father doesnt disturb me she is everything i hoped she would be and even more
244 as expected the priests claims about the gender of god has created quite a stir amidst devote catholics the intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the experience of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors
244 though his superiors have disapproved father oneal says that he will continue dedicating his life to god and spread the word of the holy mother
244 i wish to continue preaching i would like to share my new knowledge of the mother the son and the holy ghost with all catholics and even all christians god is great and almighty despite being a woman

251 apple is hosting its spring forward event tonight where it will finally be answering the many questions surrounding the watch the cupertino-based giant however is not resting on its laurels and is reportedly already working on the next-generation watch

254 the right-hand man of abu bakr al-baghdadi was killed by an airstrike in mosul an airstrike in the isis stronghold of mosul killed at least two members of the group including an aide to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi according to the iraqi defense ministry reports that baghdadi himself had been killed by a us airstrike circulated in turkish and kurdish media wednesday and were repeated to the daily beast by multiple iraqi sources but a pentagon official denied that the isis leader was dead there is no validity to the rumor that we ve killed baghdadi a senior defense official told the daily beast
254 the iraqi defense ministry announcement first reported by al arabayia did not specify whether the airstrike was carried out by american or iraqi forces but nbc news reports that a senior security official confirmed it was a us airstrike the article does not clarify whether the security official is american or iraqi but quotes them as saying that three isis leaders were killed including baghdadis aide abu hajar al-sufi an explosives specialist and commander in the town of tal afar
254 there have been no public statements yet from us officials on the reported airstrikes
254 while the us air war in iraq has been steadily expanding since it began in early august thursdays reports provide the first public indication that isiss senior leadership is being directly targeted
254 the rumors of baghdadis death that spread through northern iraq yesterday may have been triggered by uncertainty over who died in the airstrikes that reportedly killed his aide its also possible that claims of baghdadis death could have come from isis itself as part of a deception campaign to cover the leaders tracks and obscure his true status and whereabouts
254 multiple sources including kurdish intelligence officials and former iraqi army officers told the daily beast wednesday that baghdadi had died somewhere in syria after being wounded in a recent airstrike and fleeing iraq to seek medical treatment
254 this was not the first time that rumors of baghdadis death have surfaced without an independent press to verify new information unverified claims can be spread quickly through iraq as speculation outpacing facts and gets taken for the truth
254 but the new reports that isis leaders were killed by airstrikes in mosul coming only a day after a flurry of claims about baghdadis death in syria suggests the groups leadership is increasingly vulnerable and that baghdadi may be on the run and seeking sanctuary in syria where president obama has not yet authorized military intervention

255 is there a pet door on the pearly gates
255 during his weekly address in st peter 's square pope francis comforted a young boy who was distraught over the recent death of his dog by telling him one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ the <number>-year leader of the roman catholic church said according to time paradise is open to all of gods creatures
255 the statement by the pope was welcomed by animal rights groups and humane societies across the globe who see it as a repudiation of traditional catholic teaching dating back hundreds of years that holds that animals cant go to heaven because they have no souls
255 my inbox got flooded christine gutleben senior director of faith outreach at the humane society the largest animal protection group in the united states told the new york times almost immediately everybody was talking about it
255 some catholic scholars however have warned that the popes comment was made casually and should not be taken as official church doctrine others point to earlier comments that seem to suggest that pope francis has long held beliefs that animals can go to heaven
255 he said paradise is open to all creatures father james martin a jesuit priest and editor at large of the catholic magazine america told the times that sounds pretty clear to me
255 the statement has also stirred up debate between vegan groups and their counterparts in the meat industry with groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals peta saying the popes statement aligns with the view of heaven as a peaceful place and could convince more catholics to avoid eating meat
255 its a vegan world life over death and peace between species said sarah withrow king director of christian outreach and engagement at peta im not a catholic historian but petas motto is that animals arent ours and christians agree animals arent ours theyre gods
255 pope francis statement worried many in the multi-billion dollar meat industry for whom the idea of catholics not buying meat especially those holiday hams and turkeys in the lead up to christmas equals a potentially large loss of revenue

276 gill rosenberg a canadian-israeli woman who isis had claimed to have abducted posted on facebook monday afternoon that she was safe and secure on sunday contributors to a number of jihadist platforms had claimed that the islamic state group had captured a female zionist soldier fighting with the kurds against the islamic state from kobani
276 a message allegedly posted by gill rosenberg on her facebook account monday afternoon gill rosenberg 's facebook profile
276 a message posted through rosenberg 's facebook account monday gill rosenberg 's facebook profile
276 international business times was unable to verify that rosenberg herself was responsible for the post
276 rosenberg <number> who migrated to israel from canada in <number> is believed to have served for two years in the israeli military according to a report by haaretz she had earlier claimed through photos published on the same account that she had joined kurdish forces battling isis in iraqi kurdistan in the countrys north
276 jihadists believed to be loyal to isis had claimed on sunday that rosenberg along with a number of female fighters had been abducted near kobani and that the israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture however a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims citing kurdish sources who said that rosenberg was nowhere near kobani
276 this is false propaganda by is kurdish sources told the times of israel we can say with a high level of certainty that no israeli volunteer or any international volunteer for that matter arrived to fight in the city of kobani in syria
276 the israeli government which on sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture had also stressed that the information was of dubious credibility according to a report by the times of israel i can not confirm that report of rosenbergs capture and i hope that it isnt true israels defense minister moshe yaalon had reportedly said
277 according the latest in a string of scoops from <number>to<number>mac battery life has been a pressing concern for apple throughout the development of the apple watch and for the first time sources familiar with the watch 's development have provided some early figures on what consumers can expect when the device ships sometime this year in short apple watch will exhibit similar longevity to what we ve seen from many android wear devices on the market today
277 apple was originally shooting to eke out an entire day of battery life from apple watch obviously that 's not all active use in fact the company is said to be shooting for <number> to <number> hours of active application use with the screen turned on that 'll vary depending on how heavily you use it of course but since the wearable 's display will often be turned off throughout the day and because the iphone handles a lot of computing tasks apple is apparently hopeful that the watch can make it from morning until you place it back on the wireless charger at night <number> hours of combined active and passive use seems to be the bar as of right now
277 there 's only so much that can be done to extend a smartwatch 's battery life
277 this is n't unlike what you 'd get from the current field of android smartwatches use them constantly and they wo n't last a day but that changes with more average use notably the pebble smartwatch continues to blow away the field in terms of battery life but it 's a very different device when compared against a moto <number> or the apple watch in standby and low-power modes <number>to<number>mac 's sources say apple watch can last through two or three days and if for some reason you want to use it strictly as a timepiece and leave the screen on at all times it 'll die out after three or so hours using it as a workout companion your gym routine should n't last more than four hours
277 apple is reportedly testing apple watch 's battery life aggressively and in large numbers <number>to<number>mac claims the company has distributed over <number> units as the development process continues and while the iphone is a critical companion to apple watch the device itself may be more powerful than some expected <number>to<number>mac says the cpu inside is more or less equally as powerful as the a<number> chip that powered the iphone <number>s and ipad <number> and remains in the current-generation ipod touch considering the tiny form factor we 're expecting the same fluidity and responsiveness that have become hallmarks of ios but as for the battery apple can only do so much the simple fact is that battery technology does n't evolve at nearly the same rate as the smartphones in our pockets and wearables on our wrists the company will undoubtedly keep pushing for improvements as apple watch 's launch nears it 's expected to ship beginning in march

308 nigeria said on friday it had agreed a ceasefire with islamist militants boko haram and reached a deal for the release of more than <number> schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago
308 there was no immediate confirmation from the rebels who have brought five years of havoc in africas top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of chibok in april
308 i wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded said the head of nigerias military air chief marshal alex badeh adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect
308 government spokesman mike omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and boko haram had given assurances that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well
308 their release would be a huge boost for president goodluck jonathan who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence the biggest security threat to africas biggest economy
308 apart from one appearance on a boko haram video the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the cameroon border although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released

308 commitment among parts of boko haram and the military does appear to be genuine it is worth taking seriously the security source told reuters

343 a small furor has erupted over whether a saudi television station blurred out the image of us first lady michelle obama in the broadcast of her and president barack obamas meeting with new saudi king salman today in riyadh saudi officials deny the claim
343 the new king shook hands with president obama at the erga palace but didnt acknowledge the first lady during a brief meeting at the funeral for king abdullah barack and michelle obama cut short their trip to india to attend the funeral

348 one of the best things about the internet is the speed at which it allows information to be shared unfortunately this means all information  even false ones like the news about the six-day darkness that would envelop the world in december
348 the report nasa confirms earth will experience <number> days of total darkness in december <number> was published by huzlerscom considering the site labeled itself as offering a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief the story should have been taken with a grain of salt at the very least
348 according to the story nasa confirmed that the earth would be experiencing six days of nearly complete darkness from dec <number> to <number> the event would supposedly happen because of a solar storm that would spur enough dust and debris in space that <number> percent of sunlight would be blocked out
348 nasa head charles bolden was said to have made the announcement asking people to remain calm given a solar storm so bad the biggest in <number> years was going to happen that it would block out the sun for <number> hours
348 reporters also apparently interviewed people to hear what they had to say about the event with michael hearns responding with a we gon na be purgin my ngga six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam
348 how people took that response seriously is a mystery
348 six days of darkness if it were to really happen sounds like a big deal but the story downplays it in the end noting that officials said that major problems would not arise anyway a certain earl godoy a nasa scientist reiterated there would be no problem because the planet could survive on artificial light during the event
348 nasa has not made any official statements regarding this six-day period of darkness descending on earth
348 the good news is that this means the world will not be falling into darkness for six days in december the bad news is that people are n't very good at separating what 's real from what 's not liking and sharing the story thousands of times since it first came out on oct <number>

350 if the past few weeks of nonstop media onslaught about north korea and the interview just havent quite appeased your insatiable appetite for kim jong-un antics fear notthere are other things literally cooking up his tunic sleeves
350 everyones favorite guilty pleasure the sometimes-reliable sometimes-not uk rag the daily mail reports that the dictator is eyeing scotland as the location for his next business venturean expansion of the restaurant chain known as pyongyang which is owned by the north korean government and used to generate additional cash flow overseas there are currently franchises in cities such as beijing shanghai kuala lampur jakarta and more recently amsterdam
350 although the proposed new location may seem a bit random scotland has allegedly been singled out for two reasons the first is that kim jong-un and other elite north korean officials love drinking scotch whisky his father the late kim jong-il was a bigger fan of hennessy supposedly spending some <number> a year on the cognac
350 in september of this year when the united kingdom debated whether or not scotland should be granted sovereignty kim jong-un was allegedly a supporter of the countrys independence becauseas choe kwan-il managing editor of north korean paper choson sinbo told uks daily mirrornorth korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of scotch whisky so scotland and north korea can be beneficial to each other
350 in terms of the potential new addition to the pyongyang chain the daily mail claims that the other reason why north korea might single out scotland is that they want to make nice with some european countries in hopes of improving diplomacy and their global image north korean leadership watch editor michael madden tells the mail that kim jong-un has been trying to think of ways to buddy up with scotland ever since its bid for sovereignty and has more hope for acceptance there than in those other judgy european countries like england and france madden also claims that tourists in north korea are already encouraged to pay tips in scotch rather than won the local currency
350 jenny town of the us-korea institute is also quoted as arguing north korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy as north korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation in this case that may mean trying to snuggle up with a pyongyang franchise that will attempt to win over the scots via dishes such as barbecued cuttlefish kimchi pine-nut gruel dog meat soup and a mysterious aphrodisiac made out of bears although these foods are served at other pyongyang restaurants there is no specific evidence that theyd make their way onto menus in scotland
350 there has been no official announcement from north korea confirming that they are opening a restaurant in scotlandin fact a korean embassy official recently denied the story to the independent but as it is with many other wealth-generating businesses in north korea many critics believe that cash flow from the restaurant chain goes straight to jong-un himself and his small group of elites with virtually no trickle-down to the north korean people
350 kim jong-un <number> gained quite a bit of attention earlier this year for his diagnosis of gout a disease commonly caused by overindulgence in rich fatty foods it was widely reported that he became ill and developed a limp and facial swelling because he had become literally addicted to emmental more commonly called swiss cheese

385 professor perrucci found the text in the archives of the vatican while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the roman era
385 the text as a whole is a narrative of the authors return journey from parthia to rome that occurred in <number> ad recorded in a highly rhetorical style of four sheets of parchment he describes many different episodes taking place during his trip like a a violent sandstorm in mesopotamia and visit to a temple in melitta modern day mdina in malta
385 the part of the text that really caught m perruccis attention is an episode taking place in the city of sebaste near modern day nablus in the west bank the author first describes the arrival of a great leader in the town with a group of disciples and followers causing many of the lower class people from neighbouring villages to gather around them according to velleius that great mans name was isous de nazarenus a greco-latin translation of jesus hebrew name yeshua hanotzri
385 upon entering town jesus would have visited the house of a woman named elisheba who had just given birth to a stillborn child jesus picked up the dead child and uttered a prayer in aramaic to the heavens which unfortunately the author describes as immensus meaning incomprehensible to the crowds surprise and amazement the baby came back to life almost immediately crying and squirming like a healthy newborn
385 marcus velleius paterculus being a roman officer of campanian origins seems to perceive jesus christ as a great doctor and miracle man without associating him in any way to the jewish concept of messiah
385 many tests and analysis have been realized over the last weeks to determine the authenticity of the manuscript the composition of the parchment and ink the literary style and handwriting have all been carefully scrutinized and were considered to be entirely legitimate the dating analysis also revealed that the sheepskin parchment on which the text is written does indeed date from the <number>st century of this era more precisely from between <number>-<number> ad
385 this new text from an author known for his reliability brings a brand new perspective on the life of the historical character that is jesus of nazareth it comes to confirm the gospels on the facts that he was known for accomplishing miracles and that his sheer presence in a town was enough to attract crowds of people

401 google inc plans to buy about half of redwood city 's mammoth pacific shores center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the peninsula real estate scene
401 even by the standards of googles relentless real-estate acquisition spree this is a big one the world 's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly the project is owned by the blackstone group and starwood capital and managed by equity office
401 the purchase which could close later this month would be mountain view-based googles most dramatic real estate move this year it opens up another front in the search giants rapid peninsula expansion after big deals in palo alto and sunnyvale and it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways pacific shores is spitting distance from the port of redwood city where google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network
401 google declined to comment blackstone didnt respond to a request for comment im told the sale is close to being finalized though its still possible the deal could still fall through google 's deposit is n't yet non-refundable a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line a person familiar with the transaction said
401 if any deal is done by anyone wed welcome them to redwood city mayor jeffrey gee told me in a phone call on friday adding that hed wait to comment on googles potential arrival until a deal is complete
401 brokers said the impact of the acquisition if completed would ripple through the commercial real estate market assuming google intends to occupy the space tenants currently in the buildings which are more than <number> percent leased would have to find new space as their leases end and google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots
401 it adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground because theres going to be that much more pressure on space demand said tim grant a veteran bay area office broker with avison young in foster city
401 the deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north peninsula coming just weeks after box inc agreed to lease a major office project in downtown redwood city
401 this is one more thing grant said weve always been thought of as maybe but id rather be in san francisco or southern silicon valley suddenly the middle maybe isnt a bad place to be

406 according to the latest research from our wde wearables research service the apple watch smartwatch will ship <number> million units worldwide in <number> apple will quickly become the worlds number one smartwatch vendor with <number> percent global marketshare this year
406 we forecast total global smartwatch shipments to grow <number> percent from <number> million units in <number> to <number> million units in <number> most of the smartwatch growth will come from the new apple watch which we forecast to ship <number> million units worldwide in <number> apple will quickly become the worlds number one smartwatch vendor and capture <number> percent global marketshare this year
406 the apple watch is the catalyst to ignite the global smartwatch market apples famous brand loyal fan base deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its watch however apples first-generation watch is not yet perfect for example apples watch hardware design is arguably less attractive than some rival models such as the huawei watch battery life may not be as long as many traditional wristwatch owners are used to and apples premium pricing may be challenging for mass-market consumers apple will need to upgrade tangibly its second-generation watch to stay ahead of competitors later this year
407 the health-focused smartwatch that apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month according to a new report
407 apple 's original concept for the apple watch was one that would track blood pressure heart activity stress levels and other functions the wall street journal reported monday citing sources familiar with the device but none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues according to the journal some features did n't work properly others proved too complex and some would have required regulatory approval as such apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena the sources said
407 due out in april the apple watch will enter an already crowded playing field competing with products from samsung sony motorola microsoft lg and others it 's been thought that apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features but if the journal 's sources are correct some of those features proved more challenging than expected
407 for example the journal reported apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate but the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people such as those with hairy arms or dry skin and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch according to the journal 's sources
407 apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood but again the results were inconsistent further if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice they would have required approval from the food and drug administration  something apple was trying to avoid
407 the difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at apple to dub the project a black hole as it sucked in more and more resources one of the sources said
407 as a result apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable yes several key health and fitness features will be available and useful especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market but apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch including its variety of styles its ability to act as an adjunct to the iphone its support for apple pay and its voice-activated controls
407 will those features and the apple name convince enough consumers to consider the apple watch over the competition in december piper jaffray analyst gene munster projected unit sales of <number> million for <number> wall street has been forecasting sales of <number> million to <number> million apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture <number> million to <number> million watches for its first quarter of release
407 whether initial sales are as healthy as expected apple will certainly come out with future models those could even include some of the health features that did n't pass muster the first time around the journal 's sources added

409 this is not the first or even second time a suspect has identified themselves to newfoundland cops on facebook
409 curnew says hes not surprised constantine has so casually commented on his own wanted post on facebook this has been the case at least twice before weve had it happen on one or two occasions that a person has contacted us curnew explained to buzzfeed news when you send it out on social media word comes around quick

423 the reported ceasefire between the nigerian government and boko haram the terrorist group still holding more than <number> girls captive does not appear to be working out as violence over the weekend put the possibility of the girls  return on even more tenuous ground

424 apple has remained mum as to its pricing strategy for the three versions of the apple watch to be made available next year only saying that the price will start at <number> for the entry-level version likely to be the apple watch sport which features light aluminum and a sweat-resistant band made from a rubbery material
424 but jewelry industry experts believe the apple watch edition which comes with <number>-karat yellow gold or rose gold a sapphire crystal display and venetian leather for its bands will cost around <number> with other jewelers estimating that apple 's fanciest smartwatch could be priced as much as <number>
424 watch expert chad rickicki of pittsburgh penn told techcrunch that an <number>-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the apple watch could rack up as much as <number> for the raw material that does not even include the smartwatch 's electronic components and the profit margin apple plans to tack on to the device all in all consumers can expect to pay <number> for a gold smartwatch says rickicki
424 however other jewelers are not as optimistic saying that we need to understand the materials apple used for its smartwatch to be able to peg it at a more accurate price ariel adams founder and editor of watch blog ablogtowatch says apple adopted watch industry terminology for the apple watch the term <number>-karat gold he says likely means the watch is made of solid gold not gold-plated otherwise apple would have used the term gold-plated
424 the current market price for gold is <number> per ounce if for example the apple watch weighs two ounces that is already <number> just for the gold that is not even considering the special process apple 's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is twice as hard as standard gold adams says apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in china than the facilities used by swiss-based watchmakers but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted
424 adams also points out that there is also the cost of sapphire glass to contend with estimating that apple has to pay around <number> to <number> for the sapphire crystal case of the edition smart watch sapphire manufacturing adams says is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated adams thinks the high-end apple watch will not cost anything less than <number> and could go up as much as <number>
424 the edition is going to be far far less mass-produced than the steel version he says i think it 's going to have a much different type of distribution it 'll be a much more exclusive product
425 rep duncan hunter r-calif said tuesday night that us border officials have caught at least <number> islamic state fighters or people with ties to the group as they tried to enter the us through mexico a claim that was immediately disputed by the obama administration
425 i know that at least <number> isis fighters have been caught coming across the mexican border in texas hunter said on fox news tuesday night theres nobody talking about it
425 when asked by host greta van susteren how he knows this hunter said because ive asked the border patrol greta
425 the department of homeland security spokeswoman disputed hunters claim on wednesday morning
425 the suggestion that individuals who have ties to isil have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground said marsha catron dhs continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border
425 but hunters office replied by saying hunter was told directly by a senior official that people with ties to the islamic state have in fact been apprehended
425 a high level source within the border patrol told the congressman otherwise said hunter spokesman joe kasper the congressman was conveying what he knows and what he was told it makes sense that the left hand of dhs doesnt know what the right hand is doing its been that way for a long time and we dont expect that to change
425 hunter said tuesday that the biggest risk that the islamic state poses to americans is by trying to enter the us illegally and committing acts of terrorism
425 if you really want to protect americans from isis you secure the southern border he said its that simple

431 tiger woods is n't golfing he 's taking some time off to rest to heal and to work on his game but according to one dude who probably does n't know anything it 's all a coverup and woods is actually serving a secret tour suspension for a failed drug test today both the pga tour and woods 's agent flatly deny the claim
431 the drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer dan olsen and was made on a lansing mich sports talk radio show on friday morning who the hell is dan olsen good question he played a single full season on tour in <number> has n't played a pga event since <number> and now mostly caddies and gives lessons but he had this to say

431 there is no truth whatsoever to these claims we categorically deny these allegations said ty votaw executive vice president of the pga tour woods 's agent too
431 these claims are absolutely unequivocally and completely false agent mark steinberg said they are unsourced unverified and completely ridiculous olsen is walking back everything he said telling espncom his friday comments were only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts which is a claim that relies on a pretty loose definition of the word opinion
431 olsen went on to say that i 'll be looked at as just some crazy fucking nobody making accusations about tiger and it might have been the first true thing he 's said in four days

451 comcast the cable company widely applauded for its outstanding customer service has unfairly come under fire for its totally reasonable reaction to a customer 's complaint
451 according to the consumerist a customer identified as conal claims he was fired from the accounting firm where he worked after a comcast rep called his boss and told on him for trying to report his terrible customer service experience to comcast higher-ups
451 the story starts as most comcast stories start with the cable company charging conal for services and equipment he neither requested nor used when conal tried to cancel his subscription in october <number> comcast reportedly sent him <number> worth of equipment he did n't request stuff like modems dvrs etc and charged him for it when conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges they refused to acknowledge the mistake
451 so conal decided to escalate the issue to the company 's controller but when he spoke to someone in the office there she was equally unhelpful no one ever sorted out conal 's customer-service request
451 this conal claims is where it gets messy the accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from comcast contacted his employer to say conal had called to express his displeasure with comcast the call kicked off an ethics investigation that led to conal 's firing
451 according to the consumerist
451 comcast maintained that conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name but believes that someone in the comcast controllers office looked him up online and figured out where he worked
451 when he was fired conals employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from comcast that summarized conversations between conal and comcast employees
451 plus though his company consulted with comcast conal argues that bringing their name up would n't have helped his situation in the first place

461 karam said officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack but the collusion might have gone beyond just one town theres a connection we will determine if it was coordination or subordination but its clear to me that they were working together he said of police and drug traffickers in the area

462 throughout the three-plus years of the syrian civil war one oft-sung refrain among some american officials has been that arming syrian moderates whoever they may be is a dicey proposition because the weapons could fall into the wrong hands
462 despite these objections the united states eventually sent military aid to the free syrian army last year the policy change was precipitated by syrian dictator bashar assad 's violation of the obama administration 's red line after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians
462 last month with the rise of isis in mind congress approved the president 's plan to to train and arm the syrian rebels there was some familiar dissent at the time how will we ensure that the united states weapons we are providing to syrian rebels will not get into the wrong hands as they did with the rebels we supported in libya representative barbara lee asked
462 on the same day as that vote islamic state fighters first encircled kobani a syrian town near the turkish border attacking the largely kurdish town and inspiring vigorous american airstrikes on monday hoping to decisively turn the tide in the battle the united states airdropped weapons to the syrian kurds of kobani by way of explanation especially to a skeptical turkish audience us secretary of state john kerry offered that not aiding the kurds in their fight against isis is both irresponsible and morally very difficult
462 unfortunately with that one airdrop the weight of the american dread about where its weapons might go also landed according to the associated press some of the weapons meant to reach the kurds ended up in islamic state hands instead
462 the cache of weapons included hand grenades ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the islamic state the associated press said the video was consistent with other reporting the syrian observatory for human rights british activist group added that more than one cache of weapons might have been snatched up by islamic state fighters
462 of course this would n't be the first time that islamic state fighters have captured american weapons this might just have been the easiest
464 amazon the cyber store that sells everything plans to open its first physical store at <number> w <number>th street in midtown manhattan just in time for the holiday season the experimental store will work as a mini-warehouse for some same day deliveries in new york it 'll surely serve as a nice little billboard too
464 the new brick-and-mortar shop is actually across the street from the empire state building so it 's clearly primo real estate that 's surely why analysts think that amazon is opening the space as a marketing effort it does n't hurt that the company will be able to show off its now sizable lineup of products including kindles of all kinds and the new fire phone the store will also handle pick-ups and returns
464 this is not the first time that amazons 's toyed with the idea of a physical presence however rumors were rampant a couple of years ago that the company was going to open a similar-sounding store in seattle but hey why open a store in a small city when you can open a warehouse at the foot of the empire state building wsj

468 the state of north dakota has named a new publicly-owned landfill after president barack obama
468 in an overwhelming <number>-<number> vote the state senate advanced a bill naming a <number>-acre site currently under construction after the nations <number>th president governor jack dalrymple is expected to sign the measure into law tuesday
468 when completed the barack obama memorial landfill will be the largest waste disposal site in north dakota and the <number>th largest in the united states it will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries
468 we wanted to do something to honor the president says republican state senator doug perlman who was the lead sponsor of the bill and i think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to obamas presidency
468 we originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain but then someone jokingly suggested we name it after obama i never thought and idea like that would actually pass but i was pleasantly surprised
468 the president is hardly popular in north dakota the most recent poll in december <number> found that obama has a <number> approval rating in the state although that figure may have fallen further in the year since yet even considering the political climate seasoned observers are surprised that two democratic lawmakers voted for the bills passage
468 i supported obama because i thought he would end the wars in the middle east says allison mitchell a progressive democrat from grand forks but he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home
468 i guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because im a democrat but honestly i dont really care anymore maybe this small act of protest will wake him up
468 ordinary citizens in the state also seem to approve of the governments choice

521 apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development according to the wall street journal the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate blood pressure and stress levels based on the conductivity of the skin unfortunately the sensors they tested just did n't pass muster which is n't entirely surprising since we ve reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past the company 's engineers found that hairy arms dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results and they did n't find a solution in time
521 apple watch became known as a black hole within the company the wsj 's sources said as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time the lineup of watches due out in april are a lot different from the original one apple envisioned and are more of an iphone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer
521 still the company 's expecting to sell a ton reportedly ordering around <number> million units from its asian suppliers just for the first quarter half of those are the entry-level apple watch sports while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number as for cupertino 's original vision well there 's always a chance that we 'll see it come to life in the coming years the company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears  the first iphone did n't have <number>g

523 this past weekend images of a starbucks psl-inspired condom took social media by storm
523 is this a ploy to get basic bitches of the world to stop procreating will they actually be able to convince a potential partner to wrap it up with something as bizarre as this is there even a demand for a product like this
523 the image is an altered image of durexs flavored taste me condom line which just begs me to ask one question can your genitals taste flavors
523 oh wait thats not what they were getting at is it
523 there have been no official corporate announcements determining if this will be a reality or not but after seeing this image spread why wouldnt durex look into this
523 if theres anything that could get the population on the condom train it would have to be the psl trend right

545 but something 's clearly not right with macrumors reporting that documents stored in icloud drive are disappearing from apple 's iwork apps upon reset they 're also vanishing from os x yosemite which will bring icloud drive to mac users later this fall right now it 's ios users along with yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem icloud drive is also available on windows but it 's unclear if the issue has popped up there it 's also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to icloud drive

555 seidel is no stranger to inclement and chaotic weather as hes been reporting out of extreme conditions for years in this case he was in the thick of a storm in north carolina when according to williams he lost his cell phone connection to the nbc studio and thus didnt realize he was live on-camera and while he took off his gloves and fiddled with his phone to call them back turned away from the camera it painted a very particular picture basically it kinda looked like he was pissing in the snow and that was all it took for social media to explode
555 social media owes our friend mike seidel an apology the intrepid and fearless weather channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here saturday night thats when the rumors hit that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow of course williams is well-known to be a good sport with a decent sense of humor so one hopes his request for an apology for seidel isnt too stern though really it wouldnt much help if it was hes calling for social media to apologize after all so good luck with that nor would it have been a big deal if he actually had been ahem writing his name in the snow because believe it or not everybody has to go now and then even the people on the tv theyre just like us
555 notwithstanding however williams nbc and seidel himself one assumes wanted to clear the air about this humble mix-up and thats all well and good unfortunately it does steal away basically all the replay value of that misunderstood footage though if i wanted to watch somebody struggle to make a phone call with their back to me id well i wouldnt because i dont want to see that i just want to see weather reporters sneakily peeing in snow drifts is that so much to ask

557 protesters march in support of the girls kidnapped by members of boko haram in front of the nigerian embassy in washington on may <number>
557 the nigerian government said friday that it reached a cease-fire agreement with boko haram the jihadist organization that kidnapped <number> girls in april according to the afp
557 a ceasefire agreement has been concluded between the federal government of nigeria and boko haram said air marshal alex badeh nigerias top military officer
557 a second nigerian official told afp that the ceasefire would include provisions for the release of the kidnapped girls
557 they have agreed to release the chibok girls said hassan tukur a secretary to president goodluck jonathan who served as the governments representative in talks with boko haram
557 but some experts questioned the credibility of the officials claims in part because news of the agreement comes as president jonathan prepares to launch a re-election bid announcing the return of the girls whose abduction inspired the hashtag hashtagzz could help jonathans electoral aspirations even if the claim turns out not to be entirely true
557 the nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past the government even once claimed to have rescued the girls
557 in particular experts questioned the credibility of danladi ahmadu who the government said was boko harams representative in the talks
557 i have never heard of ahmadu and if boko haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the groups leader abubakar shekau shehu sani a boko haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government told afp
559 two aussie mates had to be talked out of the gnarly honour of eating what they claim is the world 's oldest burger which they bought at an adelaide mcdonald 's <number> years ago
559 according to the pair casey dean then <number> and <number>-year-old eduard nitz stopped off at their local restaurant in the mid-<number>s to pick up some burgers
559 in the order was a quarter pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend
559 he never turned up instead asking the pair to keep it safe for when he was in the city next
559 now <number> years later it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries
559 we 're pretty sure it 's the oldest burger in the world mr dean said
559 it started off as a joke you know we told our friend we 'd hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed
559 the months became years and now <number> years later it looks the same as it did the day we bought it perfectly preserved in its original wrapping
559 the pair showed off the mould-free specimen on the project tonight teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity
560 as if we needed another
560 updated ok were somehow supposed to live on earth eating sandwiches and believing that a man who walks like paul rudd wears paul rudds face and we assume quacks like paul rudd is not actually paul rudd
560 vanity fair reached out to the actors reps who denied that the man in the video was rudd were calling shenanigans because superheroes never want their true identities revealed
560 so update wink wink nudge nudge the man in the video is definitely not paul rudd either that or we have a much bigger clone problem on our hands than we initially assumed
560 earlier look weve always suspected that paul rudd was a super nice guy while we would normally be suspicious of someone who doesnt age seriously take a look at clueless and then remember that was <number> years ago his adorable stories about teenage kegger antics being too ripped for his ant-man costume and punnily helping people announce their impending offspring help keep those suspicions at bay
560 and now a new video coupled with a little bit of investigative twitter journalism twournalism really drives the point home hard recently a unnamed man went on a homophobic rant at the dallas airport eventually trying to get violent with the man he was yelling at as he lashed out a group of passers by tackled him and pinned him to the ground restraining him until police could come and handcuff him and guess what one of those randos was none other than paul rudd
560 yep keep an eye out for him in a blue checked shirt and olive-colored jacket jumping on and holding the dude down wonkette has the backstory of how we figured out it was ant-man himself
560 just add this incident to the growing list of reasons we suspect rudd is an actual superhero

570 you want a gold apple watch you say then it 's going to cost you a lot
570 the vanilla variant of apple 's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs <number> however if you 're willing to spend big cash on something that has the apple logo on it the company would be more than willing to accommodate
570 according to analyst john gruber the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the united states gruber predicts that the gold apple watch would cost <number> the figure is basically just a guess however it 's not an uneducated one
570 most people think i 'm joking when i say the gold ones are going to start at <number> i could n't be more serious gruber wrote in a blog post the lowest conceivable price i could see for the edition models is <number>  but the gold alone just as scrap metal might in fact be worth more than that
570 gruber claims that apple told him that the gold version of the apple watch is made of solid <number>-karat gold it is not gold-plated this caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device
570 he based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than <number> he cited a leaked price list for rolex from <number> luxury watch companies do n't set prices for their products they leave that to their authorized dealers this means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price in the list an <number>-karat gold rolex had a price tag of <number>
570 gruber suspects that the reason apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they do n't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be
570 what does apple watch actually do or rather what does watchkit allow we do n't know and apple is not talking even off the record one factor is that the software and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress it is far from a finished product he said
570 aside from the gold version gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs <number> it 's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch nonetheless the apple watch is expected to ship in early <number>

588 all the signs are that the video is genuine we have no reason to believe that it 's not a spokesman for the foreign office told afp
588 the video showing the beheading of david haines who was abducted in syria last year was released by is militants late saturday it was the third beheading of a western hostage by the group in less than a month
588 after chairing a meeting of the government 's emergency cobra committee sunday cameron condemned is which has conquered vast swathes of territory in iraq and syria in recent months as the embodiment of evil and vowed that the uk would do everything possible to find hainess killers
588 we will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice no matter how long it takes the grim-faced premier said in a televised statement from downing street
588 he continued step by step we must drive back dismantle and ultimately destroy isil is and what is stands for we will do so in a calm deliberate way but with an iron determination
588 we will not do so on our own but by working closely with our allies not just the united states and in europe but with our allies in the region

589 the reveal of the apple watch was unusual for cupertino which has traditionally announced products that are ready to launch we wo n't be seeing the smarwatch until next year and apple is still keeping a few of the details under wraps including the specs and price
589 but one source claims to know what the internals of the smartwatch will be the word comes from analyst timothy arcuri of cowen and company who quotes a source from apple 's supply chain
589 apparently the component creators believe the wearable will pack in <number>mb of ram and offer <number>gb of ram as standard which puts it on an equal footing with the top android wear devices out there right now such as the samsung gear <number> and the lg g watch r
589 arcuri also says that apple might be offering an <number>gb version of the watch as well though it 's unclear whether this information also comes direct from the source  or whether it 's speculation on his part
589 juice it up
589 finally arcuri also says he expects the apple watch to feature a wireless chip similar to the one found in the iphone <number>s which actually included a gps radio however that would contradict apple which stated that the watch will need an iphone in order to use gps so we 'd say it 's less likely
589 speaking of chips chipworks has provided a visual teardown of the apple watch internals and it reckons it 's spotted the broadcom wi-fi chip that cupertino has chosen for its debut wearable
589 the important takeaway point is that if chipworks is right the bcm<number> chip used will mean the watch should offer minimal power consumption in the connectivity department
589 however the word right now is that apple 's smartwatch battery will last a day in its current state so the company might have to look elsewhere in the watch if it wants to insert a little more juicepower before launch

593 a pga tour golfer said he has sources who tell him that tiger woods is currently serving a one-month suspension for ped use
593 tiger woods has had a tough career as of late plagued with injuries and surgeries that have complicated his strong golf swing and now that hes taken a leave of absence until his golf game is tournament ready hes facing criticism
593 more from golf <number>  tiger woods agent pga refute claims of ped suspension <number>  rickie fowler and kid rock give advice to tiger woods <number>  ian poulters caddie chases a duck video <number>  rory mcilroy thinks us is desperate for ryder cup win <number>  yahoo fantasy golf picks the honda classic <number> this criticism blew up monday morning when professional but not well-known pga tour golfer dan olsen went on a radio interview with david mad dog demarco on <number> wvfns the game in lansing mi and claimed that tiger woods is serving a suspension for using peds
593 i heard hes on a month suspension olsen said and its kind of a strong witness a credible person thats telling me this its not testosterone but its something else i think when it is all said and done he is going to surpass lance armstrong withainfamy
593 wow dan olsen who are you
593 olsens dislike for tiger woods must be really strong if hes going to go on radio and make wild claims that havent been evidenced by anything or anyone else
593 as if this wild claim wasnt enough olsen went on to basically say that tiger is just one big cheater and dragged rory mcilroy into it
593 tiger hes got some problems now olsen said one of the big problems nikes been giving tiger a ball that i would almost bet hasnt been testedrory played it too remember when rory signed the nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year he was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too so if you go to tour events nike pays them pays the tour staff and the range staff they pay them to get all those balls back thats why tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away he played a ball that nobody else could play
593 again wow dan olsen is going all in on tiger woods staking his reputation which obviously isnt much because most people have never heard of him to call out tiger as a cheater

600 nigeria says reaches deal with boko haram over abducted girls reuters nigeria extremists agree to immediate cease-fire associated press why nigeria was able to beat ebola but not boko haram the atlantic six months after girls abducted nigerians protest near president 's house reuters nigeria and boko haram reportedly reach cease-fire huffington post chief of defence staff air marshal alex badeh told senior military officials from nigeria and cameroon meeting in abuja that a ceasefire agreement had been concluded between the government and the insurgents
600 i have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development he added
600 badeh 's announcement came after a senior aide to president goodluck jonathan hassan tukur told afp that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks as well as for the release of <number> girls held captive since april
600 but a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution
600 jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost
600 multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called danladi ahmadu whom tukur claimed represented boko haram at the two meetings in neighbouring chad
600 i have never heard of such a man ahmadu and if boko haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group 's leader abubakar shekau said shehu sani a boko haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government
601 an explosion and a crater reported near the capital of nicaragua raised suspicions on monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by earth this weekend and struck our planet but nasa scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside managua was even a meteorite at all
601 the blast left a hole <number> feet <number> meters wide and <number> feet <number> meters deep outside the international airport serving nicaragua 's capital some nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby
601 but outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid dubbed <number> rc which passed harmlessly by earth over the weekend about the size of a house <number> rc passed within <number> miles <number> kilometers of our planet on sunday
601 information is limited but the miss distance of <number> rc actually precludes any related meteorite impact at the managua crater says mit asteroid expert richard binzel by email
601 managua meteorite
601 managua residents reported the blast just after midnight in some news reports geophysicist wilfried strauch of nicaragua 's institute of earth studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact
601 however nasa asteroid expert don yeomans author of near-earth objects finding them before they find us says that outside experts suspect the crater was n't caused by an impact
601 this event was separated by <number> hours from the close earth approach of <number> rc so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated says yeomans because the earth moves about <number> miles <number> million kilometers in <number> hours there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact

638 origins on <number> october <number> the national report published an article claiming that the town of purdon texas had been quarantined after a local family of five tested positive for ebola purdon is located <number> miles from dallas the city in which ebola patient thomas eric duncan died of the disease shortly after duncan 's death the centers for disease control cdc disclosed that a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital had contracted the hemorrhagic virus while caring for duncan

639 the world health organization is looking into reports that isis fighters in iraq have been showing up at hospitals with ebola symptoms
639 according to the pro-government iraqi newspaper al sabaah an unknown number of isis militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of mosul about <number> miles north of baghdad the paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into mosul from several countries in africa related isis massacred every man and boy over <number> in muslim town
639 its not yet clear whether the isis extremists actually have ebola or another disease ebola symptoms include fever vomiting diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever and doctors in mosul might be unable to even test for ebola
639 who spokeswoman christy feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the isis-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be ebola however united nations workers are not allowed to work in isis-controlled areas in either iraq or syria so a un operation to help either isis militants or any civilians in the areas who contract ebola is unlikely
639 feig told mashable that theres been no official notification from the iraqi government that the terrorists disease is in fact ebola
639 isis is against western science and medicine as a rule but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with ebola-like symptoms anyway since taking control of mosul in june <number> isis has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them
639 kurdish news website rudaw reported in nov <number> that isis executed six doctors in mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to isis the group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week
639 the us has been hitting isis with air strikes since mid-november and the pentagon confirmed in december that the strikes have killed around <number> fighters including three senior isis officials
639 an ebola outbreak however unlikely probably wouldnt help matters much

652 the apple watch might have been four years in the making and the most jony ive-centric apple product yet but the company didnt get everything it was wishing for from the device
652 according to a new report from the wall street journal apple originally wanted its smartwatch to focus far more prominently on health-related innovations only to be forced to go in another direction midway through the project
652 if apple had had its way the apple watch would have boasted smart sensors capable of tracking blood pressure heart rate and even stress levels but despite hiring top people from the biosensor industry the technology didnt work quite as well as had been hoped
652 problems were apparently posed by apple watch wearers with hairy arms and dry skin with sensor results also varying depending on how loosely or tightly the watch is worn despite a heavy drain on apple resources engineers were unable to create a suitable solution in time for the company to reveal the device
652 as a result the apple watch shipping in april will be far more of an iphone accessorycompanion than had originally been planned which is no doubt useful for growing apples interlocking ecosystem but is less good in other ways although apple has the luxury of taking its time with products yesterdays new yorker story reveals how much pressure there was to announce a new category of device post-steve jobs
652 while theres still a lot to be excited for the health-tracking applications of the apple watch were ones that people are very excited about apple has already had success introducing healthkit into top hospitals and a medically approved wearable could potentially help grow relations between apple and the healthcare industry
652 in a recent interview steve wozniak discussed health-tracking as one of the most potentially exciting features of the apple watch cult of mac has also written about the potential of the apple watch becoming your digital doctor
652 sadly it seems were going to have to wait at least a couple of generations before the technology can live up to that billing

655 elon university in north carolina banned the word freshman from its website and student orientation claiming its sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims
655 its replacing the term with first-year
655 the term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time leigh-anne royster the schools inclusive community wellbeing director told the college fix
655 given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way she added

655 ironically schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word freshman
655 but no matter greg zaiser vice president of admissions and financial planning insists that it will make the school a better place for women telling the fix that people consider freshman to be a sexist word
655 as an inclusive community elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body zaiser said in an e-mail to the fix

674 a satirical website has poked fun at the chinese practice of choosing alternative english names in a report urging citizens to think carefully before making their decision
674 the site which is done in the style of the state-owned cctv website warns people against picking a name that could cause offence or simply make no sense at all many chinese people prefer to use an english name particularly if they conduct business with the west but the satirical site suggests people should avoid fictional characters names with the potential for sexual innuendo or random words like dragon fish or lawyer which could come back and haunt you if you want a call back from that serious law firm in america
674 an english name should come with a feeling  or idea about what sort of person you are and where you come from so names such as satan or dumbledore are out the website says women are told to think carefully about food names such as candy lolly or sugar which might be seen as stripper names there 's also a lengthy warning about names with sexual connotations especially when used in conjunction with dong or wang which are used as slang for male genitalia so avoid anything like bunny wang  at all times the website says instead a traditional name like elizabeth catherine william or george is considered a good choice pick one of these if you 're looking for a safe  english name often with implications of wealth the website advises
674 correction <number> december <number> an earlier version of this story said the post came from the official cctv website the post was actually from a satirical news site

687 robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks like bolting a car together or making lollipops but now they are moving into the security business
687 microsoft recently installed a fleet of <number>-feet-tall <number>-pound robots to protect its silicon valley campus the robots are packed with hd security cameras and sensors to take in their organic protein-based surroundings theres also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry it can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if theyre stolen
687 the k<number> robots come from a california company called knightscope which calls the robots autonomous data machines that provide a commanding but friendly presence sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say
687 lets be honest though the robots look pretty damn cool theyre like modern versions of r<number>-d<number>
687 thankfullyor sadly depending on how you look at itthe k<number> robots dont have any weapons on them all they can do is assess a situation sound an alarm to defuse it or call a human security officer to the scene there are however plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future
687 microsofts new protectors are fairly autonomous a single charge will last <number> hours and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low it will return to a charging port and plug itself in it can fully recharge in <number> minutes which is pretty insane
687 there are plans to one day expand the use of knightscopes robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units we cant even imagine what would happen if elon musk heard about this

688 the islamic state terror group has burned the corpses of five of its fighters due to the belief that they had contracted the deadly ebola virus according to an iraqi health official who told kurdish paper rudaw
688 the islamic state organization incinerated five militants infected with ebola to prevent further spread of the disease in mosul iraq said faisal ghazi who is part of iraqs health committee in its council of ministries he added isis had proof that these militants were infected with ebola
688 on new years day breitbart news reported that multiple iraqi and kurdish news outlets had claimed that islamic state fighters in mosul iraq had contracted the deadly virus iraqi news outlets claimed at the time that ebola had started to spread in a mosul hospital
688 a world health organization who official told mashable at the time we have no official notification from the iraqi government that it is ebola
688 kurdish news site xendan elaborated further reporting that the isis fighters symptoms were similar to those who had contracted ebola an iraqi paper claimed that the virus had made its way into mosul through jihadists who were recruited out of africa
688 however most of the islamic states africa-based recruits have come from countries where ebola has not had a documented presence it also remains unclear whether mosul health officials would even have the means training or education necessary to test for ebola furthermore an iraqi government spokesman ahmed rudaini told al-maalomah news that mosul simply doesnt have the technology available to confirm an ebola case
689 cnn  the mystery surrounding north korea 's erratic young leader kim jong un only deepens by the day
689 he has not been seen publicly in more than a month rumors are flying that kim is ill with gout diabetes even possible problems with his ankles now a group of defectors say they believe kim 's younger sister kim yo jong may be running the country while he recuperates
689 the north korea intellectuals  solidarity a think-tank run by defectors says kim yo jong may be at least temporarily leading the government the group has not revealed the source of its information and cnn can not independently confirm it but kim yo jong 's star appears to be rising
689 why has north korea decided to talk now
689 michael madden who runs the blog north korea leadership watch says kim yo jong has been identified in north korean media as deputy director of the workers  party a very powerful position
689 victor cha an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies who previously handled the north korea account with the national security council says kim yo jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions
689 clearly it 's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system cha says i can see how it 's possible that she 's in some sort of temporary position it 's very difficult for the north korean system to run without one of the kim family at least titularly in charge so if kim jong un is indisposed she 's really the only available body that 's left in terms of a direct kim family line
689 is kim jong un still in charge of north korea

719 in north korea no one can have the same name as supreme leader kim jong un
719 according to reports north korea previously banned anyone from sharing the name jong un newborns can not be given the name and citizens who bore it before the ban were required to assume new names
719 south korean media outlets including kbs and yonhap news agency said the name ban was contained in a directive from <number> which was issued months before kim jong un came to power and was only recently leaked outside north korea
719 the leaked document said that all party organs and public security authorities should identify residents who shared the supreme leader 's name and train them to voluntarily change it per the guardian
719 people named jong un  said to be a common korean name for both men and women  apparently were directed to change their names on official documents such as birth certificates social security cards and school diplomas
719 according to the bbc it was likely that there was little forewarning of the name ban since kim jong un  the youngest son of predecessor kim jong il  had been relatively unknown to the general public prior to his ascension to head of state
719 a south korean government official this week confirmed the authenticity of the directive reports the new york times
719 its true that in north korea they now allow only one jong un the official who was unnamed told the paper
719 according to yonhap news agency the pyongyang regime issued a similar name ban when kim jong il was in power and when his father north korea 's founding leader kim il sung was as well

720 there have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman with an iraqi official denying on wednesday she was al-baghdadi 's ex wife
720 but a lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about <number> days ago in northern lebanon travelling with a fake id are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader
720 islamic state is group leader abu bakr al-baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in mosul after he established a self-declared caliphate across iraq and syria on july <number> <number>
720 the woman who has been named as saja al-dulaimi was travelling with two sons and a daughter interior minister nouhad mashnuq told the lebanese mtv channel late wednesday
720 he said dna tests showed that the girl was baghdadi 's child
720 dulaimi is not abu bakr al-baghdadi 's wife currently she has been married three times first to a man from the former iraqi regime with whom she had two sons  he said

721 on mondays edition of cnn tonight host don lemon released audio allegedly recorded in the canfield apartment complex at the exact time of michael browns death on aug <number> the audio features a man speaking via video chat about unrelated topics you are pretty he says at one point the recording is regarded as such an important piece of evidence however because one can clearly hear at least <number> gunshots ring out over the course of the <number>-second file first a group of six shots then four more
721 the mans attorney lopa blumenthal appeared on cnn to discuss the tape i was very concerned about that pause because its not just the number of gunshots its how theyre fired and that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up she has since reached out to the fbi which has sent representatives to meet with blumenthal and her client they thought this would be an important part of the investigation she said
721 at the time he didnt even realize the import of what he was hearing blumenthal said
721 cnn reports on what the new evidence could indicate attorney chris chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots
721 its the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting especially with an unarmed victim because at this point mr brown is defenseless he has no weapon said chestnut who represented the family of jonathan ferrell
721 like brown ferrell was an unarmed african-american man who was shot and killed by a white police officer
721 but if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the brown incident the pause doesnt automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer
721 to be fair there could be other explanations for that pause said attorney van jones co-host of cnns crossfire maybe the officer will say well i fired and he kept advancing so i fired again
721 lemon cautioned cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of this tape and has reached out to the fbi for confirmation of their interview with the ferguson resident who says he made the recording
722 when tim cook finally announced the long-awaited apple watch on september <number> the company promised an early <number> release since then its really been anybodys guess as to when exactly that might end up being a few new rumors however suggest that well get the apple watch sometime in februarybut its likely that itll be later than that
722 today a post on <number>to<number>mac points the way back to a report from chinese site feng which itself cites taiwanese media as saying that the apple watch is likely to hit sometime in february though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome the reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal which will compose the displays of the highest-end apple watch units has led to some difficulties in manufacturing
722 however it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the apple watch then apples in good shape the software itself is still in development and as the <number>to<number>mac post points out the company has yet to release the watchkit sdk for developers to start making all the cool apps thatll run on the device
722 another report from asia this week claims that production on the apple watch isnt set to start at manufacturing partner quanta until sometime in january and with only a month of actual production it seems doubtful that apple would truly be ready to sell the watch by february and last week an unnamed apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be lucky to ship it by valentines day if that quote is true then february seems like a tall order
722 that said march doesnt seem too out of the question nor does april in fact considering that motorola promised the moto <number> smartwatch by summer <number> and didnt launch it until early september it would seem that oems are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows early <number> is simply anything before the very last day in june and barring any major disasters we should start to see apple watches on consumers wrists long before then
722 the main question though is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now

727 with hbo now however consumers will be able to subscribe directly from hbo for a <number> monthly fee reports say time warner which owns hbo is aiming to build a network of distributors to push the hbo now service to the <number> million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable tv bundle service and the <number> million cable tv subscribers who are n't hbo subscribers
727 pulling apple tv on as a partner would be a huge win-win given apple 's computing ecosystem and the access to apple smartphone consumers
727 for apple landing hbo now for its fledgling apple tv would be a major coup and compliment hbo go a mobile streaming service already available via apple tv since <number>
727 hbo 's subscriber price for hbo now however may prove a sticky point as entrenched competitor netflix has kept its prices at nearly half that cost there 's also the potential of exhausting consumers with fees given they 're already laying out money for the web tv boxes and sticks while these costs are typically much less than a cable subscription the increasing number of standalone services could prove to be confusing and ultimately more expensive at some point
727 it 's clear however that hbo believes the hbo now cost is appropriate and is n't about the change the reported pricing of <number> a month
727 it 's a premium product and it will be priced accordingly hbo ceo richard plepler said during an earnings call last month

744 if north korea 's supreme leader kim jong-un is not running the hermit kingdom then who is
744 that presumes of course that the <number>-something leader has run into serious health problems physical or political and no one yet knows that for sure  only that he has remained out of public view for five weeks

744 it was the first explicit mention of her in a state media report as a senior party official  and a sign of her ascension

767 nasa has raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in nicaragua this weekend were caused by a meteorite as the government has said
767 nasa said that while a meteorite can not be ruled out the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside the capital managua suggest something else was behind the event
767 photos showed a crater about <number>ft wide in a wooded area near managua 's international airport
767 the head of nasa 's meteoroid environment office bill cooke estimated that it would have been created by a blast of roughly the energy equivalent of <number> tonne of tnt
767 nasa said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area about <number> million people live in the nicaraguan capital
767 cooke said for something to produce a hole in the ground that big it would have generated a very bright fireball and nothing was reported despite the population so i 'm very sceptical

780 as the secretive states leader remains out of the public eye analysts wonder if kim yo-jong has assumed the leadership
780 when kim yo-jong was introduced to the public as a senior official of the party central committee in march analysts speculated that she could one day become north koreas most powerful woman
780 now as the countrys leader remains conspicuously absent from public life it has been suggested that kim jong-uns younger sister may have stepped up to help him manage the daily affairs of leadership while he battles a bout of ill health
780 along with kims wife the former singer ri sol-ju the <number>-year-old is one of the countrys most prominent women and has been photographed with her brother on public visits however it is her absence from the limelight that some believe adds weight to the theory that she may have taken over some or even all of the leadership responsibilities from her brother as he recovers from his physical discomfort
780 if kim has indeed been set aside and nobody outside pyongyang really knows then whoever has taken power is not seeking the limelight said john everard former uk ambassador to pyongyangthe visits to factories and military units that kim frequently conducted have not been taken over by anyone else they have simply stopped
780 as a woman in a very male-dominated society the theory goes she might be reluctant to push herself forward publicly straight away preferring instead to bide her time while governing from behind the scenes
780 however everard says though it is not impossible that kim yo-jong has stepped up to the leadership it is as hard to disprove this theory as it is to find anything to support it
780 kim yo-jong whose name is also spelt kim yeo-jung is believed to act as an adviser for her brother as other members of the kim family have done relatives did previously for both him and his father the late leader kim jong-il before him
780 her elder sister kim sul-song for example held a key role in the partys powerful propaganda department under their father their aunt kim kyong-hui was similarly influential until she fell out of favour last year after her husband kims former mentor was executed she is now believed to be in hiding

798 tuesdays report comes as glyn davies the top us envoy for north korea said the isolated state is neglecting its responsibilities to end its nuclear weapon program speaking in beijing on a trip through north asia davies told reporters monday its essential that north korea moves toward denuclearization
798 todays news may even prompt an acceleration of north koreas nuclear program and missile tests said hideshi takesada a professor at takushoku university in tokyo who specializes in north korean affairs hell probably be keen to show there are no issues in the nations power structure the activities of north koreas leader are the subject of intense scrutiny in asia and beyond because of his familys dynastic rule its drive to develop a nuclear arsenal and the secrecy of a regime that faces south korea across one of the worlds most heavily-armed borders

800 well heres the creepiest thing youll read all day australian dylan thomas found a tropical spider burrowed under his skin after returning from a trip to bali
800 thomas said that he noticed a strange mark on his stomach while vacationing on the indonesian island the mark started to grow literally crawling across his body as the spider explored the area underneath thomas skin
800 thomas went to the hospital in bali and was told that he was probably bitten by an insect the doctors gave him some medicine and sent him on his way well that didnt exactly solve the problem
800 over the next three days the strange mark continued to grow he eventually returned to the hospital where a dermatology specialist discovered a spider living under his skin
800 thomas wrote on facebook well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider thats been living inside of me for the last <number> days managed to get it out luckily
800 dylan thomas story started in a local australian newspaper but has now spread all over the internet of course there are some who question the veracity behind thomas claim
800 snopescom writes thomas claims were widely reported but no recorded cases of a spider burrowing into live human tissue have ever been confirmed urban legends of spiders living under human skin or laying eggs have circulated for more than a century but no evidence has emerged to indicate it is likely or possible for a spider to live under human skin it is also worth pointing out that not only has a spider never been known to harm a human in the manner described it also likely could not live for three days inside a scar and would probably suffocate in short order
800 do you think this is a true story

817 but if video evidence of kim limping is any indication the dictator is likely recovering from whatever mysterious discomfort hes been experiencing and little sis is making sure things still get done as little sisters often do
817 who is kim yo-jong

842 a <number> pound catfish was caught by a fisherman in italy according to usa today sports dino ferrari caught the huge fish in po delta while the catfish caught by ferrari was <number> feet in length and weighed <number> pounds the largest catfish ever caught weighed <number> pounds that does not mean that this wasnt a record-breaking fish however according to the report this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod
842 according to the san antonio express-news any catfish over <number> feet is considered extremely rare ferrari isnt some small time fisherman either according to grind tv the italy native is a pro at catching big wels catfish and many of these fish frequent the waters where ferrari casts his line
842 the wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region ranking behind the beluga sturgeon the largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly <number> pounds
842 the <number> pound catfish is certainly a sight to see as it looks as if it could swallow ferrari whole he posed for photos with the fish clearly very proud of his catch even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures which took him a tiring <number> minutes to reel in it is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big
842 animal lovers may be happy to know that ferrari did not keep the catfish nor did he sell it for money after his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature the guys released it back into the river where it swam off happy to live another day
842 as previously reported by the inquisitr these wels catfish arent exactly harmless this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into and it is definitely not a gentle giant by any means
842 dinos monster catch is not the sort of fish youd want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping the fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path these surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold-blooded killers
842 pictures of the <number> pound catfish are making waves on the internet today have you ever seen a catfish so big would you want to see a wels catfish in person

844 planetary alignment on jan <number> <number> will decrease gravity for <number> minutes causing partial weightlessness
844 strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today but nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on january <number> <number>
844 according to british astronomer patrick moore at exactly <number> pst am on january <number>th pluto will pass directly behind jupiter in relation to earth this rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull temporarily counteracting the earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless moore calls this the jovian-plutonian gravitational effect
844 moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred if they do so he promised they would experience a strange floating sensation
844 astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date when mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune and pluto would be on the same side of the sun within an arc <number> wide but now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach
844 but dont get too excited if you think youll be able to float around your house youre wrong but if you jump in the air at <number> am pst on january <number> <number> it should take you about <number> seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual <number> seconds
844 so mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends zero gravity day is just around the corner

846 several iraqi news sources including al sabah and the website al-maalomah reported on wednesday that several isis fighters sought help at a hospital in mosul <number> miles north of the city of baghdad after developing symptoms of ebola virus infection citing anonymous sources in a hospital in mosul al-sabah reported that two cases of ebola and <number> cases of hivaids were confirmed by health authorities in mosul the newspaper also claimed that isis recruits from some african countries brought the virus to iraq the international business times uk also carried a similar report quoting iraqi news sources but a spokesperson for the iraqi health ministry ahmed rudaini has denied reports that two cases of ebola virus infection were diagnosed among isis militants in mosul the iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection could n't have been confirmed in mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities he said only the central laboratory of public health in baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of ebola virus infection responding to inquiries from mashable a who spokesperson christy feigh said we have no official notification that it is ebola feigh said the who was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed but because un workers are banned from entering isis-held areas in iraq and syria it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases mashable however reports that a kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the kurdish news outlet xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in mosul with symptoms of ebola virus infection while iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously an outbreak of ebola among isis militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the isis-held areas it is also feared that isis militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group however the symptoms of ebola virus including vomiting diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases including malaria yellow fever and typhoid fever thus it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to ebola given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among isis fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group it is not known that isis has a significant number of recruits from west african countries where the epidemic has been reported thousands of foreign recruits to isis arrived mostly from north african countries such as tunisia libya egypt algeria and somalia where there have been no reports of ebola outbreak the ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the west african countries of sierra leone liberia and guinea recently nigerian news sources reported that isis was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country the report led the nigerian government to issue a statement urging some middle eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on nigerians applying for visas the report that some isis militants might have contracted ebola comes a few weeks after benjamin t decker intelligence analyst and iraq specialist with the middle east research firm levantine group said that isis executed about <number> doctors in mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants mosul was among several cities isis fighters captured earlier in the year <number> the militants declared an islamic caliphate in the areas they captured mosul in particular has been under isis control since june <number> the city has reportedly suffered food water and power shortages since extremist militants took over residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children on wednesday the us and its allies carried out <number> airstrikes in syria and <number> in iraq the airstrikes in syria targeted isis facilities in al raqqah dayr az zawr and kobani while the strikes in iraq hit isis buildings and positions around mosul fallujah and sinja

850 the spy agencies mi<number> and mi<number> have identified the british fighter suspected of murdering the us journalist james foley british government sources confirmed yesterday
850 the masked man with a london accent who is said to be known as jihadi john was seen in the shocking video of foleys death released by the islamic state extremist army last week
850 while sources gave no details of the man they have identified a key suspect is abdel-majed abdel bary <number> who left his familys <number>million <number>m home in maida vale west london last year he recently tweeted a picture of himself holding up a severed head
850 the intelligence agencies and police estimate up to <number> british extremists a month are now travelling to syria and iraq to fight with islamic state the rate has risen since islamic state declared a caliphate eight weeks ago us officials said america was considering carrying out drone strikes on islamic state leaders in syria as it steps up its activities in the country and could also provide more help for moderate rebels fighting president bashar al-assad
850 pentagon sources claimed president barack obama agonised for weeks over whether to authorise a mission to rescue foley and other foreign hostages delta force commandos finally launched the mission on july <number> but the hostages had been moved
850 they were ready to go in june to grab the guy and they werent permitted said anthony shaffer a former lieutenant colonel who worked on covert operations
850 writing in the sunday times yesterday british foreign secretary philip hammond accused foleys killer of an utter betrayal of everything the british people stand for it is horrifying to think that the perpetrator of this heinous act could have been brought up in britain he wrote
850 mr hammond said foleys death was a reminder to us all that islamic extremism in iraq and syria is not only causing huge suffering in those countries but is also a barbaric ideology threatening us at home
850 unless islamic state is stopped sooner or later they will seek to strike us on british soil he wrote
851 not only has the upcoming steve jobs biopic likely found an actor to play jobs it may have found an actor to play apple co-founder steve wozniak too according to the wrap seth rogen is being considered for the role variety reports more definitely that he 's actually set to play it rogen would be acting alongside christian bale who is reported to have taken the part of jobs danny boyle who made trainspotting and <number> days later is directing based on a script by aaron sorkin jessica chastain is also reported to be under consideration for a part though it is n't known who she would be playing
851 this is n't a done deal yet
851 rogen is certainly an interesting casting choice but with how little is known about this movie it 's hard to really gauge what it means for one it 's not clear how large the role of wozniak will be the film is supposed to take place in the moments preceding three major apple product launches and wozniak would n't necessarily be around for all of those having left apple in <number> we ve also seen successful pairings of strong dramatic actors like bale with traditionally comedic actors like rogen in the past to quite a bit of success see last year 's the wolf of wall street for example so it 's possible that boyle is trying to emulate that here
851 that all said the hollywood reporter says that it is n't clear if an offer has been made to rogen yet but that the film 's producers do want him on board the reporter also says that bale 's deal is yet to close and remains at a delicate stage though sorkin has suggested that he 's on board this sorkin-scripted jobs film has had a rocky development process and has already had to restart once when david fincher was dropped from being its director still it 's sounding more and more like the studio behind this film is eager to get it made so perhaps we 'll see some confirmation on all of this soon
852 after a solid week of coming to terms with the fact that steve jobs is batman we ve found ourselves in a job-less world once more now that christian bale 's thrown in the tiny circular glasses we ask you dear readers who 's your jobsian ideal
852 is it woody harrelson you see telling you to stay both hungry and foolish garey busey perhaps or maybe even meryl streepbecause who cares anyone 's better than ashton
852 so share your top picks down below and help us find the perfect steve to seth rogan 's presumably stoned ever-guffawing woz
853 it 's a common practice around the world to speed up tv shows in order to insert more commercial time the subtle speeding up can slice a couple of minutes from a <number> minute sitcom with little noticeable difference  and broadcasters can plug in two more minutes of commercials per half hour it 's a last ditch effort perhaps to extract money out of a dying media delivery system before streaming obliterates the advertising model tbs does it with seinfeld reruns see below and worldwide it happens all the time  from the bbc to india
853 but is that all there is to it  trying to make more money actually many viewers point out that tv shows and everything else move faster now in the age of the <number>-second vine the speeding up actually helps the content itself seem more contemporary here 's one commenter honestly shows move a lot faster now and the sped up version feels a little more updated than the original slower version but who even watches actual tv anymore no tv adblock on <number> of internet very little advertising happy me
854 momentum for the apple watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps one analyst believes with sales quickly escalating to <number> million units in the holiday <number> shopping season

854 bachman 's confidence in the apple watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable in particular he 's especially curious to find out final pricing application availability and battery life
854 regarding the high-end price point bmo 's analyst is n't concerned if the <number>-karat gold apple watch edition sells for more than <number> he suspects apple will sell very few units at that price as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like rolex that can stand the test of time
854 bachman also is n't concerned about suspected battery life of around <number> hours he noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iphone at night by their bedside and he expects apple watch users will do the same
854 bmo has maintained its price target of <number> for shares of aapl along with an outperform rating

855 no state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed hunters account when we inquired and hunter spokesman joe kasper declined to reveal the congressmans sources
855 fox news in its original oct <number> <number> online news report on hunters declaration quoted the department of homeland security disputing his account
855 homeland security told politifact texas that no such apprehensions have occurred an agency spokeswoman marsha catron emailed the suggestion that individuals who have ties to isil have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground dhs continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border
855 and after hunter spoke the texas department of public safety wrote state legislators saying in an oct <number> <number> email it does not have any information to confirm statements about islamic terrorists or isis fighters entering the country a dps spokesman tom vinger confirmed the messages authenticity
856 kim jong-un has broken both of his ankles and is now in the hospital after undergoing surgery a report in a south korean newspaper claims
856 the north korean leader has been missing for more than three weeks fueling speculation about what could cause his unusual disappearance from the public eye some rumors indicated that he was suffering from gout others speculated it was a sign of some sort of internal struggle within the secretive north korean regime and some even said he was simply getting ill by eating too much swiss cheese
856 but on tuesday south korean newspaper the chosun ilbo added a new twist reporting that kim was hospitalized in mid-september and had surgery at the bonghwa clinic a hospital for high-ranking government officials in the capital pyongyang
856 i heard that kim jong-un injured his right ankle in june after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended an anonymous source was quoted as saying
856 apparently kim sprained his right ankle while wearing cuban heels during a tour of military bases and factories the paper reported kim was seen limping in july during a tv appearance
856 the paper said that kim was still in the hospital under heavy protection from bodyguards and was receiving visits from several government officials
856 this rumor seems to confirm what north korean state media had said on thursday when state broadcaster korean central television reported that kim was not feeling well and was suffering from an uncomfortable physical condition
856 have something to add to this story share it in the comments
858 is fidel castro dead yes a man named fidel castro has died but hes not the famous castro you might be thinking of the prospect that the leader of cuba might have died is circulating on the internet and the rumors claim fidel castros death was supposed be announced at an official conference according to the castro health rumors but already cuba has denied these rumors
858 in a related report by the inquisitr its claimed that ian fleming the author of the famous james bond series helped former president kennedy to hatch a fidel castro assassination plot
858 according to the el nuevo herald the rumors claimed fidel castro dead because a man named fidel castro odinga the son of an important politician in kenya died over the weekend at the age of <number> years old
858 castro odinga was the son of raila odinga the main opposition leader in kenya and was considered a possible successor to his father it is possible that his death and his name have confused many users of twitter and these have begun to spread the word about the supposed death of the cuban leader
858 kenyan police are currently investigating odingas death and these headlines may have encouraged rumors about the cuban leader
858 according to laiguana tv its also possible that a blog by yusnaby perez may have sparked rumors that claimed fidel castro dead because he had not been in public in many months
858 how strange it is the first year since i can remember the anniversary of the revolution that fidel does not appear
858 thursday marked a year since the former cuban president made a public appearance castro has apparently received foreign dignitaries at his home in havana but has not commented publicly on the recent changes between cuba and the united states that was announced on december <number> <number>
858 the rumors were increased even further when italian newspaper corriere della sera reported on fidel castros death the newspaper quickly retracted its report but not before the alleged news about castro went viral
859 kim jong-un had ankle surgery and is now recovering at an estate north of pyongyang

873 cnn  new york city will apparently change its policy on marijuana possession giving officers the option to merely ticket offenders instead of requiring an arrest a law enforcement source told cnn on monday

874 following the deadly shootings at charlie hebdo a french satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed wednesday in the best way they knew how with their own set of tribute cartoons artists from the independent the washington post and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack which took the lives of <number> people a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists charlie hebdo editor stephane charbonnier was perhaps the most high-profile of those killed wednesday and for those who flocked to facebook instagram and other forms of social media wednesday it appeared that banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy but come wednesday night fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that no banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image
874 though it at first appeared as though the artist was responsible for the cartoon after it surfaced on a banksy instagram account its believed that the account does not belong to banksy himself not only because banksys official website insists that the artist keeps off social media specifically referencing his lack of a facebook or twitter account this short-lived instagram was the only account that was ever linked to banksy but also as business insider notes the cartoon image is far too low-res for an artist with banksys notoriety writes the site
874 another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size the image uploaded to the fake banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work he wouldnt want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad that said the image itself is striking and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in paris so though its possible banksy did not design the cartoon and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute banksy would publish its worth digesting appreciating and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech

879 matt taibbi is taking a leave of absence from pierre omidyars first look media according to new york magazine the move comes after disagreements with higher-ups inside omidyars organization a source close to first look confirmed today
879 over the last year however the center of gravity of the organization has shifted as omidyar and his silicon valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission over the summer omidyar appointed a longtime confidante john temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in hawaii to be the president for audience and products putting him in a position above eric bates the former rolling stone editor who was brought on as a first look editorial director who is close to taibbi
879 the leave of absence also comes three months after i first reported that omidyar had apparently ordered taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats like uh pierre omidyar to a wider mission involving more comedy than reporting around the same time i heard rumors that eric bates was also unhappy at the organization
879 ive previously had a uh spirited email conversation with taibbi about both claims although taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were not for publication a strange demand coming from an editor at a site thats about leaking confidential documents i emailed taibbi again today to ask if i can publish his responses in the light of todays news he replied no you may not
879 here then for what little its worth is my side of the correspondence from back in july in which i laid out the state of first look as i saw it with a little help from some well placed sources the discussion was uh spirited on both sides all words below are mine youll just have to try to infer what taibbis stated position might have been
879 a note on not for publication off the record i thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a not for publication conversation given first looks own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear taibbi wasnt being entirely truthful about his place at the company i ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses with taibbis words redacted im sure some readers with disagree i welcome the discussion
879 also an important disclosure taibbi previously worked with pandos mark ames on russian ex-pat newspaper the exile it has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms i didnt discuss this post with mark before publishing
879 ok here are the emails
879 the email thread began with taibbi 's emailing me to deny that omidyar had changed his strategy i had emailed first look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply taibbi 's email was headed not for publication

924 sheikh munajjid had an explanation ready to back his fatwa he argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being under the saudi kingdoms strict interpretation of sunni islam such an action is considered a sin while noting his ruling he added
924 god has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul including trees ships fruits buildings and so on
924 in simpler terms the cleric was ok with building snow figurines representing anything non-human or animals for that matter as amusing as it might sound children might now be left with other inanimate objects only how does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree isnt what the religious leader pondered much upon

924 fortunately for the children the fatwa hasnt been accorded a date of implementation and moreover no local government authority has officially confirmed or denied the same apparently any cleric in saudi arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa however they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of islam and must have valid basis under saudi law

931 lebanese security officials described the woman as a high-value catch and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through dna testing if so the revelation would support the claim of international involvement the us and other states have samples of baghdadis dna from the nine months he spent in us custody in iraq in <number>
931 the british foreign office said it had nothing to add to the reports
931 analysts in iraq said that if true the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence the self-styled leader of the new islamic caliphate which covers part of eastern syria and iraq operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered baghdadi is believed to have three wives two of them iraqi and one syrian
931 it is close to impossible that she would have operational details said an iraqi intelligence officer but she could still be useful on things like locations
931 baghdadi is known to move frequently across iraqs north-west where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the us national security agency and britains gchq he uses trusted couriers to pass vital information often in written letters or repeated orally the fbi has put a <number>m <number>m bounty on baghdadis head
931 al-safir the lebanese news magazine which first reported the arrest said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of arsal and were being detained at lebanons military headquarters in the hills overlooking beirut
931 the woman was identified as saja al-dulaimi an iraqi by a lebanese security official and a senior political source dulaimi was one of <number> women released from a syrian government jail in march as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of <number> nuns taken captive by al-qaida-linked militants in syria according to media reports at the time

936 islamic state isis militants in mosul may have contracted ebola according to iraqi media reports of suspected cases at an is-controlled hospital in the city
936 the government and kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of ebola the world health organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to iraqi officials
936 iraq 's official pro-government newspaper al sabaah said ebola arrived in mosul from terrorists who came from several countries and africa reports mashable
936 however it is uncertain if any is recruits came from the ebola-hit regions of west africa most have come from tunisia morocco libya egypt algeria sudan and somalia
936 a number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters  symptoms malaria lassa fever yellow fever and the marburg virus could all be confused with ebola as they can also cause fever nausea vomiting and diarrhoea
936 is a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine recently executed a number of iraqi doctors in mosul for refusing to treat militants un workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory an intelligence analyst who specialises in iraq told mashable

938 a group of isis militants in iraq have allegedly gone to a local hospital to be treated for what is believed to be ebola
938 three local media outlets reported this week that a number of isis fighters have shown signs of the deadly disease and were taken to a hospital in mosul to be treated the reports are currently unconfirmed but the world health organization says that they are investigating the claims and that they are attempting to reach out to officials in the area to offer help
938 we have no official notification from the iraqi government that it is ebola whos director of communications christy feig told mashable in a statement
938 feig reportedly went on to acknowledge that despite their best efforts to offer help to area officials if ebola has in fact reached them having an impact in an isis-controlled area could prove to be challenging
938 ebola reached epidemic levels last year in parts of africa and fear that the virus would spread in the united states took over the headlines for weeks this past fall however so far the disease has yet to make any serious impact in the states
938 iraqs pro-government newspaper al sabaah claims that the disease has spread to mosul through terrorists coming from several countries in africa
938 symptoms of ebola include nausea and vomiting diarrhea bruising and severe bleeding but any of those ailments could be attributed to a number of other conditions so its not entirely clear if the reported ebola diagnoses are accurate

951 the beheading of american journalist james foley at the hands of isis militants shocked the world but forensic experts have revealed the video was probably staged with the murder happening off camera
951 the uk times reported that an international forensic science company which has worked for police forces across britain said there is no question foley was beheaded but that camera trickery and post-production techniques look to have been used
951 i think it has been staged said one expert in visual forensics after he was commissioned by the uk times to examine the footage
951 my feeling is that the execution may have happened after the camera was stopped
951 aymenn al-tamimi a fellow at the middle east forum think-tank said over the years isis militants have improved the production quality of their videos
951 the analysis by experts has highlighted a number of inconsistencies that could suggest that the beheading of foley which was seen on the video was not his actual death
951 firstly no blood can be seen even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times secondly sounds allegedly made by foley do not appear consistent with what may be expected
951 the forensic analysis expert said that no incision could be seen on foleys neck though the right hand of the jihadist partially blocked the shot
951 while the forensics company which asked to remain anonymous did not reach a definitive answer they did conclude that at some point an execution of foley did take place

971 some <number> years ago founding fathers sam adams and paul revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the massachusetts state house on thursday excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes according to the boston globe
971 the time capsule contained in a <number>-by-<number>-inch copper box is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as <number> the capsule had actually already been extracted in <number> when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items including coins from the <number>s were added to the stashthe box had then been mortared inside the state house cornerstone
971 meghan kelly a spokeswoman for the executive office of administration and finance told the globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate newspapers the seal of the commonwealth cards and the title page of the massachusetts colony records
971 time capsule has steve jobs  computer mouse
971 its believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the state house at that particular corner that inspection prompted officials to re-excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition
971 hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building but of our commonwealth and our country said secretary of state william galvin who was on hand for the capsules excavation according to the boston globe
971 as luck would have it another time capsule was recovered in boston just this past october that <number>-year-old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the old state house in downtown boston that capsule held sealed letters photographs and newspaper articles
971 video mythical roman she-wolf  cave discovered
971 as for this most recently extracted time capsule its now being held in a safe at the boston museum of fine arts on sunday examiners will x-ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week after that it will be returned to the state house cornerstone perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover
972 kfc marijuana on the menu not likely a story that began circulating on tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy but the fact is theres no sign kfc will really be selling marijuana in its stores
972 the story began at the racket report where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game while the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop there are a few problems
972 first and foremost racket report appears to be a mostly satirical website carrying multiple stories such as the fetal ink syndrome story that have been debunked by fact-checking site snopes heres snopes debunking the fetal ink syndrome tale
972 kfc also doesnt mention any marijuana sales on its official news page a thing youd think theyd mention if they were hoping to drum up sales
972 another concern is banking while marijuana shops were assured early in <number> that they could have access to banks many report still having difficulties though the original story claims that kfcs pot sales will be cash only in order to protect the restaurants funds this would be no protection
972 if marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal a question that is in limbo at the moment with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority but laws still on the books then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected that is if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash
972 this could not only be a concern for kfc but for its parent company yum brands
972 notably a kfc turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a south park episode and there is another kfc that does indeed sell marijuana but its not the fried chicken chain instead its a shop called kind for cures a california pot shop based on that same south park episode that assures on its website this aint no chicken joint
972 calls to yum brands and to kfc tuesday evening were not immediately returned but there are no signs that kfc marijuana will be available in the bucket next to your extra crispy any time soon

979 celebrity dog cesar millan should have died according to a post on the site noticiasunamcom but there are many obvious oddities in the post  viral inspector shows why it probably is fake
979 tv personality and hunduppfostraren cesar millan has died of a heart attack reports the site noticiasunamcom the news has been widely adopted  just over <number> interactions on facebook accordance sharedcountcom  and shocked many oh becomes so sad rest in paradise cesar millan writes one of many swedes who have turned to facebook to express their condolences
979 but they probably unnecessarily it is unclear what exactly noticiasumamcom is a kind side but a reputable news source it is at least not
979 to begin with there are many warning signs about the article itself if millan 's death it is the hispanic-side single article in english and has under its byline written by frank william abagnale a famous forger of checks whose lives laid the basis for the movie catch me if you can and whatever abagnale do nowadays so it 's probably not writing for noticiasumamcom
979 additionally it stated the source of the claim to be a press conference with millan 's wife jahira dar searches shows that this press conference is not mentioned anywhere else than right on noticiasumamcom which almost certainly means that the conference never even took place to make doubly sure is jahira dar and cesar millan not actually married at least according to a mingling article in the daily mail from november <number>
979 according to the article millan have been put in the hospital yesterday afternoon ie on tuesday but the night of wednesday swedish time appeared still up happy tweets and status updates on millans twitter  and facebook feeds  the last came as late as an hour before the site 's article was published cesar millan has a television program on the national geographic nor where there any information about his death
979 if there are rumors about a celebrity death so you should always wait until they are confirmed by a close relative or associate of the person in an interview with a credible source in the case of millan there is no such confirmed data and both indian international business times as dutch de telegraaf warns that page that published the news is not credible
979 viral reviewer can therefore conclude that the source of the allegation of cesar millan 's death is not credible although millan 's team have not directly denied the information we dare say he most certainly not dead we have searched his team for comment

1025 apple is reportedly limiting what apple watch apps are capable of doing ruling out certain features in order to ensure battery life is not too heavily drained in the initial model which could tarnish the high-profile launch
1025 according to business insider developers working on applications for the new apple wearable have cautioned that consumers should temper their expectations of what the initial apple watch is capable of
1025 the caution harkens back to the initial iphone launch when the app store did not exist and only the apps pre-loaded by apple could be used while the smartphone ecosystem has dramatically changed since then and apples app store has proved a template for a new industry the apple watch looks as though it may mirror this model until capabilities improve
1025 the primary issue is battery life and apples continued attempts to increase the time between recharges earlier reports suggested that the device would have only four hours of active battery life and many of the sensor features initially touted to be included have been cut due to inconsistency
1025 those sensors that do remain are the source of many of the battery issues according to sumit mehra cto of y media labs an app studio which has been developing content for the apple watch
1025 sensors take up a lot of battery and they dont want every app out there on the apple watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life and then its not a watch anymore if i have to charge my wrist every four hours said mehra in a statement to business insider
1025 apple has not yet released its watchkit sdk for developing standalone apps for the apple watch with developers at the moment limited to creating extensions to iphone apps that will function on the watch this helps save battery for the wearable and means apps can run on the iphones superior processor but also limits apple watch apps to notifications app extensions and presenting summaries of information essentially limited versions of what the iphone can already do
1025 with the expected launch of the apple watch less than a week away and apple predicting huge numbers of sales for its first ever wearable consumers might be wise to rethink what the device is going to be capable of at least for the time being

1046 the weather channels mike seidel has taken a lot of ribbing about what he was doing live on network tv this weekend but he didnt do what online news sites and youtubers suggest he did
1046 seidel was reporting from sugar mountain north carolina saturday where an early season storm dropped <number> inches of snow nbc nightly news anchor lester holt introduced seidel while the meteorologists back was turned to the camera seidel was hunched over fiddling with something to an awful lot of people who saw holt dump out of the live shot it appeared seidel was zipping up his pants having answered natures call
1046 the ny daily news headline taunted nbc meteorologist mike seidel appears to relieve himself during broadcast
1046 but that is not what happened at all said shirley powell the weather channels spokesperson seidel she said was using his cell phone as an ifb that is short for interruptible feedback which is how reporters in the field get their cues from the control room the phone lost its signal just as the anchor was introducing the live shot powell told poynterorg that seidel yanked off his gloves turned from the howling wind and was dialing the ifb when holt tossed to him since seidel didnt have a phone signal he didnt know he was on the air while he frantically dialed the phone seidel tucked his heavy gloves between his knees to keep them from blowing away when he finished dialing he yanked his gloves back on and turned to the camera but holt was already calling off the shot and moving on seidel was left hanging in the winter wind
1046 im glad for you to tell what really happened powell told me
1046 the crew was using a liveu mobile live system which is a backpack sized phone based transmitter andseidel would not have had a live truck engineer who might have alerted the control room of the communication problem we still dont know why the producer in the control booth took the shot live on the air with seidel turned away
1046 on his weather channel bio page seidel is asked what is your most embarrassing moment on the air he answers do you want a list whatever was on that list before now just took a back seat and sadly for seidel the video will live forever online

1047 kim jong-un could try and open a restaurant in scotland serving delicacies such as dog meat soup north korea experts claim

1048 amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos the new york post reports
1048 the service would exist in addition to its <number> prime membership subscription which includes free two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music tv and movie streaming options
1048 the wall street journal reported similar plans in march pegging the service as being free at the time amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service
1048 the post however does n't say that the service would be free and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with netflix and hulu while under-cutting them on price netflix costs and hulu plus cost <number> a month
1048 amazon 's sally fouts sent the following via email we currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our first episode free feature on amazon instant video and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers were often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service
1048 at its core the idea of this service makes sense
1048 amazon could use this new cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they 'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to prime while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who do n't care about prime 's free shipping but want a netflix alternative

1049 according to galvin the box-shaped capsule was placed by the revolutionary-era duo in <number> a year when adams was governor and when construction began on the state house and its iconic dome which would eventually be overlaid with copper by revere
1049 both he and hatchfield said that based on historical records the box is believed to contain coins a plate and a revere-inscribed plaque  but no one knows for sure

1056 experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in nicaragua 's crowded capital managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite as the government has said
1056 the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries but it did leave a crater measuring <number> metres across and was felt throughout the capital
1056 the us national aeronautics and space administration on monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside managua on saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event
1056 bill cooke head of nasa 's meteoroid environment office estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of <number> ton of tnt
1056 nasa said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area about <number> million people live in the nicaraguan capital
1056 for something to produce a hole in the ground that big it would have generated a very bright fireball and nothing was reported despite the population cooke said so i 'm very sceptical
1056 nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed <number> rc which passed very close to earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about <number> meters big or the size of a house

1063 the <number>-inch model would slot neatly into the current range which is comprised of an <number>-inch and <number>-inch model the new version is slimmer than both predecessors but sports the same tapered  design from top to bottom
1063 but such a slimline frame comes at a price as apple appears to have done away with standard usb ports and sd card slot a single usb type-c port remains and the gaps between keyboard keys narrowed in order to minimise space
1063 four speaker grills positioned between the screen and keyboard double up as ventilation as the model has no fan the trackpad is taller than that of the <number>-inch model and the keyboard has been designed to sit edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop with a notably slimmer margin

1064 dubai a prominent saudi arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen describing them as anti-islamic
1064 asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country 's north sheikh mohammed saleh al-munajjid replied it is not permitted to make a statue out of snow even by way of play and fun
1064 quoting from muslim scholars sheikh munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being an action considered sinful under the kingdom 's strict interpretation of sunni islam
1064 god has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul including trees ships fruits buildings and so on he wrote in his ruling
1064 that provoked swift responses from twitter users writing in arabic and identifying themselves with arab names they are afraid for their faith of everything sick minds one twitter user wrote related german minister calls for cancellation of anti-islam rally to be held in dresden saudis begin public caning of blogger first <number> of <number> blows are administered <number> stranded indian workers in saudi arabia to return home
1064 another posted a photo of a man in formal arab garb holding the arm of a snow bride wearing a bra and lipstick the reason for the ban is fear of sedition he wrote

1065 according to a new survey conducted by analysts at ubs interest in the smartwatch market is continuing to grow ahead of the apple watch launch early next year of the <number> respondents asked to partake in the survey across four different countries about <number> percent cited that they are very likely to buy a smartwatch in the next year based on projections of apple 's iphone sales and the current installed base of iphones compatible with the apple watch the analysts predict apple will sell <number> million apple watches within the first nine monthsfigure <number> indicates that <number> of respondents <number> out of <number> are very likely and <number> <number> out of <number> somewhat likely to buy a smartwatch in the next <number> months that is a three-fold increase vis  vis the <number> respondents claiming to already own a smartwatch and a four-fold increase if we assume that around one-third of the currently owned smartwatches are actually fitness bands based on an estimate of <number> million iphones compatible with apple watch being in customers  hands by the end of <number> ubs suggests this could translate to <number> million apple watches sold in the first <number>-<number> months of availability depending on supplies
1065 in a smaller survey of customers who registered as very likely to purchase a smart watch the apple watch placed second to the samsung gear in buying intentions although ubs expects those positions to reverse once the apple watch becomes available
1065 the analysts also expect the new apple wearable to redefine the category much like previous products from the company have done for their respective technological categories despite first-version limitations in daily charging and iphone tethering ubs sees significant potential for the apple watch and predicts it will become the spiritual successor to the iphone in the long-termcellular and battery technology is not yet sufficiently miniaturized to fit in the watch and allow independent functioning we would think the ability to do so is maybe five years away in fact the screen size differential may mean that the watch and the iphone will prove complements rather than substitutes arguably that is the way the ipad and mac might be playing out different products for different jobs
1065 given that about two-thirds of apple 's profit is generated by the iphone the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables with a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on apple may be readying for the time when the apple watch encroaches on the smartphone market the apple watch is set to launch in early <number> reportedly in the spring according to an internal video from retail chief angela ahrendts

1066 we still dont know the exact date the apple watch will ship but a new rumor claims you wont be able to pick one up at bestbuy walmart or other non-apple stores at launch
1066 apple plans to make its timepiece an apple store exclusive according to german distribution sources who claim resellers will be shut out so cupertino can suck up as much apple watch profits in the first year as possible
1066 we cant verify the sources so the rumor should be taken with some healthy skepticism however weve already heard rumblings that apple is redesigning apple stores just for the apple watch launch leaning on apple store to provide the best possible sales experience during the introductory year would make sense
1066 the online apple store will also sell the wearable vaults will supposedly be added to apple stores to keep the pricey gold apple watches secure stores will also have glass viewing cases for the expensive models customers will be able to ask specialists to try the different models on while smaller tables are also supposedly planned so that the apple watch sport and others are better staged
1066 apple most likely wants to keep the selling experience on its terms until people are more familiar with what an apple watch is the iphone was exclusively available at apple stores and carriers before distribution deals were later struck with best buy walmart target and others
1066 tim cook revealed the apple watch will ship in april the exact pricing for apple watch an edition models as well as launch details are expected to be announced at an event in march

1070 gaza city maan  hundreds of palestinians were evacuated from their homes sunday morning after israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border flooding the gaza valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm

1074 apple is in negotiations to make the apple tv a launch destination for hbo 's standalone streaming service reportedly called hbo now which could launch in time for the fifth season of game of thrones premiering april <number> according to a new report
1074 plans to launch a streaming service independent of a cable or satellite subscription have been public knowledge since october until now though there was no name attached or any pricing or availability details
1074 but on wednesday a new report from the international business times claimed that the service said to be known as hbo now will cost <number> per month about as much as viewers would pay a cable company though providers often force customers to pay for additional bundles if they want hbo
1074 apple has allegedly been most aggressive in trying to secure an apple tv deal the set-top box is already one of the homes to hbo go which requires an authenticated subscription through cable providers but it 's believed that apple could add a second app for hbo now
1074 hbo 's development partner on the service is said to be major league baseball advanced media that company is reportedly building both the back-end and the front-end but with some leeway on its deadlines so hbo executives can be sure the service works at launch
1074 during last year 's season premiere of game of thrones the on-demand hbo go service collapsed under network traffic that left some people waiting hours or days before they could stream the fourth season 's first episode
1074 apart from the apple tv hbo now will likely appear on other platforms where hbo already has a presence such as roku and xbox it could have a significant impact on the cable and satellite industry which has leveraged networks like hbo and sports channels to deter people from jumping ship to streaming services such as netflix and hulu
1075 the tale of the harvard business school professor who flipped out because hed been overcharged <number> by a chinese restaurant took an ugly turn wednesday night the boston globes free bostoncom site which first reported the story posted a follow-up claiming that ben edelman had sent a racist email to the restaurant owner and then replaced the follow-up with an editors note explaining that the authenticity of the email couldnt be verified the boston herald has a summary of what went wrong
1075 the original story about edelman by bostoncoms hilary sargent had gone viral who after all can resist reading about a privileged harvard professor threatening legal action against a hard-working business owner because the prices on his website hadnt been updated for a while so when bostoncom retracted its explosive allegation carrying sargent and roberto scaleses bylines that edelman was not just a contentious jerk but a racist twitter exploded
1075 so what did bostoncom publish it wasnt long before screen grabs started to make their way around the intertubes j alain ferry posted a copy here what happened was that after edelman apologized to ran duan whose family owns the sichuan garden restaurant in brookline someone claiming to be edelman sent another email to the restaurant owner writing you may have won the battle duan but at least we can agree your menu is a little less slanty-eyed thats followed up by an apology for accidentally sending what was meant as a private joke which has the effect of making the mail seem more authentic
1075 edelmans domain name benedelmanorg is easily found on the web and its not difficult to send an email using any address you like the sichuan garden website offers an email form that lets you do exactly that one clue is that all of the legitimate emails bostoncom has posted from edelman are marked as coming from ben edelman whereas the racist email and subsequent apology were from benuserzzorg
1075 despite the retraction bostoncom as of this moment is still all-in on the rest of its edelman package well see what if anything comes next

1076 the united states began dropping weapons ammunition medical supplies and other equipment to fighters defending kobane on sunday night in part because turkey would not allow kurdish fighters to cross its borders into kobane to bolster the towns defenses turkish officials said they changed their mind on monday but the deal is tentative and depends on whether separate kurdish groups can resolve longterm differences to confront the islamic state

1087 this being russia getting pooped on by a bird was n't even the most ridiculous part of putin 's wwi speech putin warned that the lesson of wwi was fair warning irony is going to die forever at the end of this sentence to avoid excessive ambitions in war humankind should grasp one truth violence generates violence said the man whose overt and ongoing support for separatist rebels in ukraine which he also invaded to annex crimea has helped claim hundreds of lives and stirred up months of crisis
1087 it was on the eve of wwi when russia did everything possible to solve the conflict peacefully without bloodshed between serbia and austria-hungary putin said repeating an old russian complaint that only it really wants peace but is ignored by an aggressive west but russia was n't heard and it had to respond to the challenge in order to protect the fellow slavic nation
1087 i 'm not sure whether putin means this as an explicit nod to his involvement in ukraine but russia 's meddling there has often been internally premised on the idea that russia must save the russian-speakers in ukraine 's east so there would seem to be a parallel more ironically the ukrainians who are fighting and dying to keep putin out of their country are themselves slavic but must have forgotten to thank putin for his peace-seeking pan-slavic magnanimity

1120 pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror groups hands
1120 a us airdrop of arms to besieged kurds in kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of islamic state isis militants
1120 video footage released by isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters for in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute the boxes are opened to show an array of weapons some rusty some new a canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade
1120 the pentagon said it was investigating the claim but admitted that one of its airdrops had gone missing if confirmed it would be an embarrassment for the us given the advanced precision technology available to its air force
1120 the seemingly bungled airdrop comes against a steady stream of us-supplied weapons being lost to isis forces mainly from the dysfunctional iraqi army isis is reported to have stolen seven american m<number> abrams tanks from three iraqi army bases in anbar province last week
1120 the pentagon spokesman rear admiral john kirby told reporters that analysts at centcom headquarters in tampa florida were examining the video were still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it he said so i honestly dont know if that was one of the one dropped
1120 the us began dropping munitions supplied by kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern iraq to their compatriots in kobani which sits close to the iraqi-turkish border isis fighters have encircled much of the town
1120 kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped so its not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard he said
1120 i do want to add though that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands in fact were only aware of one bundle that did not

1122 forget targeted us airstrikes isis faces a new existential threat citing an unnamed source in a mosul hospital iraq 's official pro-government newspaper al sabaah said ebola arrived in mosul from terrorists who came from several countries and africa mashable further confirms three outlets reported that ebola showed up at a hospital in mosul for now it 's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in mosul are even able to test for the ebola virus but it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by isis a group that does n't embrace science and modern medicine
1122 as mashable reports
1122 reports that islamic state militants in mosul have contracted ebola swirled though iraqi media sources on wednesday world health organization officials said they have n't confirmed the cases but the organization has reached out to offer assistance we have no official notification from the iraqi government that it is ebola christy feig who 's director of communications told mashable feig added that who is in the process of reaching out to government officials in iraq to see if they need help investigating the cases a task that could be a challenge given the restrictions that would come with operating in isis-controlled territory it 's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in mosul are even able to test for the ebola virus a kurdish official who was convinced the cases are ebola told the kurdish media outlet xendan that the militants  symptoms were similar to those of the ebola virus citing an unnamed source in a mosul hospital iraq 's official pro-government newspaper al sabaah said the disease arrived in mosul from terrorists who came from several countries and africa if the cases in mosul turn out to be ebola a scenario that at this point seems highly unlikely it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by isis a group that does n't embrace science and modern medicine over the past few weeks militants affiliated with isis have executed more than a dozen doctors in mosul according to benjamin t decker an intelligence analyst with the levantine group a middle east-based geopolitical risk and research consultancy the question now is  will nobel peace prize winning president obama send his humanitarian non-boots-on-the-ground military advisors to help
1122 however as the international business times reports officials are denying the reports
1122 iraq 's ministry of health also denied that anyone in mosul had contracted the ebola virus which broke out in march in west africa spokesman ahmed rudaini told news site al-maalomah that mosul does n't even have the technological capability to diagnose ebola cases  only baghdad does therefore he said the reports that ebola has infected anyone in mosul are incorrect and unfounded but perhaps most concerning
1122 in the event isis does have ebola the militants could use it as a biological terror technique forbes reported in october members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others the individual exposed to the ebola virus would be the carrier national security professor al shimkus told forbes in the context of terrorist activity it doesnt take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier
1123 the very first nonsense i had to debunk in <number> was a claim that on jan <number> of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment zero g day this exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places so ive decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at years end it seems fitting that hopefully this is also the last debunking ill make in <number> but who knows theres still a week left
1123 something youll never hear me say well now ive heard it all
1123 long experience has taught me there is always a sillier claim always and youre hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that the maya calendar predicted the end of the world that the supermoon caused earthquakes and that a magnetic pole flip of the earth will cause superstorms and another saying the earth is already physically starting to flip over
1123 so whats sillier than these well we now have the claim that early next yearon jan <number> <number> at <number> pst to be exactdue to the combined gravity of jupiter and pluto you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds or at least fall more slowly depending on different sources
1123 its hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is first off this exact same hoax was pulled last year in <number> by a site called news hound now offline apparently and a lot of people fell for it here we are again a year later back at the same spot this time the joke is being made by a news site called daily buzz live which didnt even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax they even have a picture of a nasa tweet about the event
1123 theres only one problem that picture is completely fake nasa never tweeted it and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on daily buzz live whoever did it was clever adding the number of retweets and favorites but its as fake as a <number> iphone you can buy on the street in new york city
1123 after all the physics of zero g day is wrong the claim about pluto and jupiter is wrong andand this part is the real killerits based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly <number> years ago
1123 despite this its spreading around facebook and twitter so much once again that i got a lot of people asking or telling me about it thats why im debunking this thing again
1123 so to get started heres the claim
1125 dc toy collector is the highest paid performer on youtube making nearly <number> million last year unboxing disney toys however little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular youtube channel in fact her face is never shown in the video only her voice toys and hands however a recent report reveals the true identity of the youtube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking a former brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of disney collector the woman was filming both disney unboxing videos and porn in the same florida home
1125 the daily mail reports that brazilian daiane dejeus also known as sandy summers in the porn industry is the woman behind the hit disney collector youtube videos reporters tracked down information on dejeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular dc toy collector youtube channel after tracking down dejeus the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that daiane was behind the million dollar videos
1125 dejeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason the target market of the youtube channel which caters to disney lovers such as children and families may not remain viewers if they knew the owners secret dejeus was not only a disney fanatic but also a porn star going by the name sandy summers dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early dc toy collector features
1125 family and friends have identified dejeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the womans hands and arms can be seen in many of the youtube videos
1125 they pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots
1125 aside from the physical similarities former neighbors say dejeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to
1125 that is daiane she has a very childlike voice and i would recognize it anywhere most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to
1125 would you have ever imagined that the popular dc toy collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star

1127 canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages  scattering the creatures and inciting panic
1127 militants fighting for the islamic state in iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic  bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies
1127 canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages which explode on impact  scattering the scorpions and causing panic among the innocent local population
1127 although scorpion bombs sound like something out of a modern horror movie the tactic is actually thousands of years old and was first used by iraqis fighting against the roman empire
1127 hamish de bretton-gordon ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the army and nato told the mirror that isis had improvised devices to launch the poisonous creatures in <number>ft bombs
1127 he said scorpions are robust even if they are launched a couple of miles when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around
1127 some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear 
1127 mr de bretton-gordon who returned from baghdad last week where he was advising security forces said that the bombs are not causing casualties but had a profound psychological impact 
1127 the bizarre biological weapon was used as far back as <number> ad when iraqis stuffed live scorpions into ceramic pots and hurled them at roman armies marching on the fortress city of hatra

1129 update at <number> pm frisco paramedics dressed in protective gear are preparing to transport the patient to a hospital its unclear which one
1129 original post at <number> pm this just in from dana baird friscos director of communications and media relations
1130 last week a heart-warming social experiment video hit the web showing a secretly filmed homeless man using an unexpected gift of <number> to buy food for others since then the almost too-perfect clip has been featured everywhere from the la times to upworthy and generated over <number> on a donation page managed by the video 's uploader youtube personality josh paler lin
1130 according to a new eyewitness account however homeless star thomas knew he was being followed and the whole thing is bullshit
1130 bro lin drove thomas to the liquor store <number>-year-old taugan tan kadalim told vocativ claiming he was on scene when the video 's climax now seen over <number> million times was shot while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged
1130 from vocativ
1130 the <number>-year-old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the driver 's seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god it 's him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lin 's youtube channel i could n't believe it
1130 a cameraman sat in the passenger seat of lin 's car and behind him was the man who kadalim would later recognize as thomas the homeless samaritan lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video kadalim decided to stick around and watch
1130 of course given how many of this year 's viral videos were hoaxes staged or otherwise bullshit it should hardly be surprising that this one might be too unlike those videos however this one has six figures purportedly to help thomas get a fresh start in questionably controlled donations attached
1130 when pressed lin denied any part of his video had been staged or scripted there is is no way we 're making this up lin told vocativ this is real
1131 yes we ve known for a while that christian bale might be the next actor to portray steve jobs but variety now seems mighty sure the publication is reporting that our favorite batman will indeed play our favorite technology pitchman in sony 's new movie
1131 mind you variety technically says that bale is merely in talks but the rest of the article seems pretty certain that it 's a done deal
1131 in case you ve forgotten sony 's film is the one penned by aaron sorkinwho also wrote the scripts for the social network and moneyball is directed by danny boyle remember slumdog millionaire and is actually based on walter issacson 's official biography of steve jobs in other words it 's shaping up to be a class act maybe it 'll be enough to wash away memories of that other jobs film variety
1132 the value of breaking into the top <number> ranking on the app store  or higher really  is fairly well-established if not a fool-proof way to make a profit
1132 the same is true whether youre a developer in the uk or china and while apple has some fairly strongly worded guidelines about app store manipulation  that doesnt stop people trying it
1132 well now that effort seems to have been summed up in a single photograph which has recently gone viral in china
1132 the photo appears to show a woman in front of a rack of about <number> iphone <number>cs downloading apps repeatedly from different accounts it was published in local media and resurfaced on apple rumors site cult of mac and tech in asia
1132 however the photo is completely unsourced low-quality and unverified so while many have speculated this is evidence of ranking manipulation farms that 's not quite right the presence of the iphone <number>c suggests it 's a relatively recent picture but whether or not that means ranking manipulation has any effect in the real world we just do n't know
1132 also unclear is the veracity of another image going around which shows the prices being charged to break apps into the rankings list
1132 that picture claims it will cost a developer the equivalent of <number> to get an app into the top <number> and about six times as much to keep it there for a week
1132 while app store rankings manipulation is clearly an issue in china  at least there are companies willing to charge for the service as evidenced by a simple search on local e-commerce sites  whats not clear is how much of an impact this would actually have on the app store
1132 for its part apple has taken a tough line on rankings cheats apple says in its guidelines for developers that any effort to cheat the system will be dealt with swiftly and severely
1134 according to an earlier report it was suggested by a reddit user that apple might have quietly reinforced the iphone <number> plus to address the bending issues that users have been complaining about it sounded good but unfortunately as it turns out it might not necessarily have been true which we have to say is a bit unfortunate this is according to the folks at ifixit who responded to the original reddit post with their own findings according to the original post the user claims that his newer iphone weighs <number> grams more than his wifes model ifixit on the other hand who compared a day one model to a newly purchased model only noticed a <number> gram difference i just went to the store and bought a brand-spanking-new iphone <number> plus <number> gb space gray verizon unitit weighs <number> grams a whopping <number> grams more than the day one unit however as noted on the apple website there is a small note that reads size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process <number>to<number>macs source also tells them that a difference in <number> grams between any two iphone <number> plus models is expected like we said this is a little unfortunate as were sure many users would have been pleased to learn that apple could be reinforcing its iphone <number> plus models however as apple claimed back then less than <number> users had officially come forward to complain about the reported bending which means that it wasnt as widespread as many would have thought it to be but what say you are you a little disappointed by this image credit  ifixit filed in apple cellphones read more about iphone <number> plus

1139 relatives of the more than <number> girls taken by militant group boko haram in chibok northern nigeria expressed hope yesterday that a ceasefire deal said to have been signed between the nigerian government and the islamist group will end their nightmare and bring their families home
1139 however restraint appeared to be the order of the day with the details of any deal still hazy and no word yet from boko haram 's leader abubakar shekau wild celebrations might have been expected at the apparent end of an ordeal that has lasted more than six months but they were not in evidence with many cautious about what might happen but officials have made clear that the return of the girls is part of the deal
1139 we will know the negotiations were successful when we see the girls physically and then we will know it is true and then we will celebrate said bana lawan chairman of chibok 's local government told the associated press
1139 another resident community leader pogu bitrus told the news agency that people rejoiced but with caution
1139 some reports on friday night suggested the girls taken from a school in chibok back in april could be released as early as tomorrow in neighbouring chad but reuters reported yesterday citing two senior government sources that the nigerian government would be looking to secure the release of the girls by tuesday
1139 yesterday mike omeri a government spokesman said the authorities are inching closer to the release of the chibok girls he later told reuters that discussions will continue in chad next week and on the basis of those discussions we 'll have more details on the girls  release
1139 the second source quoted by reuters said that there might need to be further meetings in nigeria or the chadian capital ndjamena to iron out the rest of the details for the deal we have confidence in those we are negotiating with but we are still doing it with considerable caution boko haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could disown the deal he reportedly said

1152 is kim jong un 's sister running north korea
1152 that 's the latest question on the minds of north korea watchers amid a storm of rumors that have built up in the weeks since kim 's last public appearance on sept <number> other rumors suggest he is being treated for gout and that he has been hospitalized due to a cheese allergy
1152 with so little hard news leaking out of the hermit kingdom it 's impossible to confirm any of this including the rumor that kim 's little sister kim yo jong is the new show-runner but there is evidence that she has upped her political profile over the past few years and she may be one of the few people on the planet with direct access to north korea 's leader here 's what we ve been able to mine

1152 she may have started working for the korean workers party the political establishment of which kim jong un is the leader around <number> when her dad still ran the country she reportedly worked to clear the way for her older brother to succeed her father once he died though that 's about all we know about their relationship
1152 kim yo jong was born on sept <number> <number> by the time she was eight she was off to berne switzerland to attend school near where her older brothers were doing the same

1153 apple is still tweaking software to find the right mix of performance and survivability for example the company is targeting <number> hours of continuous exercise tracking when linked to an iphone suggesting raw data is handed off to the more capable handset for processing
1153 battery life continues to be one of the most significant technical hurdles for smartwatch manufacturers and apple faces the same predicament with its small form factor device apple watch packs in a custom-designed s<number> system-on-chip approximately as powerful as the a<number> processor as well as a retina-quality display both major draws on what is expected to be a relatively low-capacity battery cell
1153 apple has not yet set a firm release date for apple watch but holds to an early <number> launch

1198 like michael adebolajo suffocating domestic policies aimed at turning a person into an informant but which prevent a person from fulfilling their basic life needs would have left a lasting impression on emwazi he desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation but the system ultimately rejected him
1198 we now have evidence that there are several young britons whose lives were not only ruined by security agencies but who became disenfranchised and turned to violence because of british counter-terrorism policies coupled with long standing grievances over western foreign policy
1198 this case should trigger thinking about british domestic and foreign policy what risk assessments if any have been made about british counter-terrorism policy and the key part it plays in radicalising individuals how have the security services been allowed to get away with abusing british citizens without redress why are the long-standing grievances over western interventions in the muslim world been ignored

1208 they ve made this old age pensioner extremely happy 
1208 a husband who thought the voicemail message of his late wife he had been saving was lost forever has been reunited with it after <number> years describing hearing her voice again as just a wonderful wonderful sound
1208 stan beaton kept the outgoing voicemail message following his wife ruby 's death in <number> but technical work carried out by virgin media caused it to be deleted
1208 the telecoms company managed to restore it however much to the <number>-year-old 's delight
1208 they ve made this old age pensioner extremely happy he said it 's just a wonderful wonderful sound that i thought was lost forever i 'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to
1208 the moment he was played the message back is in the video above with the mirfield man becoming overcome with emotion as what under different circumstances would just be a run of the mill voicemail plays
1208 i ve always resisted changing companies because whenever i mentioned that my wife 's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no so that 's why i never changed he told bbc radio leeds
1208 sadly it disappeared i was absolutely devastated by it but also extremely angry
1208 in the early days i listened to it quite often basically it came to the point when if i felt low then i would listen to it
1210 call it newtons third law of apple analysts for every extreme reaction one way there is an equally extreme reaction the other
1210 in this case what that means is that while some doomsayers are happy to write off the apple watch as the worst thing apple has done since building its own smartphone taking on the music industry with itunes insert actual bad decision others go in totally the opposite direction and predict a landslide victory in apples favor
1210 trip chowdhry of global equities research falls somewhat into the latter category his prediction that the apple watch will have <number> apps ready to go when it launches in april and that <number> million units will have sold by the end of december
1210 chowdrys claim about <number> apps is based on his attending six apple watch-kit hackathons over the past few months although i dont doubt that there will be plenty of apps ready to go on the day id be frankly shocked if its close to that number by comparison it took the ios app store <number> months to hit <number> apps by which point it had seen approximately <number> total downloads
1210 his <number> million prediction is a bit closer to the mark and in line with other reports pegging sales as likely to fall between <number>-<number> million units in its first year on the market while <number> million would be a fraction of the number of units apple sells of the iphone it would still be enough to make it the runaway fastest selling new ios device in history the ipad by comparison sold <number> million units in its first year while the iphone moved a relatively paltry <number> million units
1210 chowdry thinks that the apple watch will then go on to convert virtually every existing iphone user noting since apple watch extends iphone functionality and provides user convenience with glance and notifications to an iphone user almost every current iphone user which are about <number> million users will also be an apple watch user
1210 chowdry also gives us a neat way of explaining away the fact that we spent upwards of <number> on an apple watch to our non-techy partners the <number> price of apple watch appears to be a non-issue he writes since on an average an apple watch user will have <number> apps installed and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting <number> devices for <number> ie <number> per device
1210 finally he argues that we shouldnt think about a killer app for the apple watch as
1210 different people have different killer applications for their devices for some it is the games for others it is the social messaging or it is the navigation or it is the music or it is video or it is email and so on and so forth debating on what is the killer app for the device is passe somewhat of pre-year-<number> thinking when the killer app used to be ringtones thinking of apple watch from the watch perspective is also fundamentally flawed the best watch on the market is probably a <number> app device it tells time may be day monday tuesday etc it may also have a stop watchthats it by april <number> <number> we are expecting <number> apple watch apps on appstore currently on an average there are <number> apps per iphone we are estimating that an average apple watch will have <number> apps per apple watch there will be no single killer app for apple watch each user will have their own set of killer apps one way to think is that the consumer is getting <number> different devices in one apple watch

1213 nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation 's capital city over the weekend but scientists are n't so sure
1213 a committee formed by the nicaraguan government determined that a new <number>-foot-wide <number> meters crater found near the capital managua 's international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike saturday night sept <number> the associated press reported
1213 some managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on saturday which would be consistent with a meteorite impact but other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism said bill cooke head of the meteoroid environment office at nasa 's marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama nicaraguan crater possibly caused by meteorite video something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky cooke said and no one reports a fireball even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds further managua is a big city with lots of potential witnesses to such a night-sky sight people saw a bright fireball the last time cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on earth in september <number> near the peruvian village of carancas and that impact occurred in broad daylight
1213 a meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence both cooke and meteor expert peter jenniskens said
1213 if this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact i would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater jenniskens of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence seti institute in mountain view california told spacecom via email
1213 no such pieces have been reported and none are visible in photos of the crater cooke said
1213 so i 'm kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater he said
1213 if a space rock did indeed carve out the nicaraguan crater the meteorite was likely relatively small about <number> feet <number> m wide if made of iron and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material cooke added
1213 some nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid <number> rc which flew by earth on sunday sept <number> the ap reported but that is not the case experts said

1271 axl rose is not dead despite internet reports to the contrary but that should come as no surprise to fans who by now have surely grown tired of the seemingly endless stream of online hoaxes falsely reporting the death of just about every major celebrity and plenty of minor celebs as well
1271 the axl rose death hoax started on a bogus site forged to look like a page on the msnbc website the authentic looking at a cursory glance anyway story was headlined sources guns n roses frontman axl rose found dead in west hollywood home at age <number> and claimed that the welcome to the jungle singer was found dead after police were called to check on the former rock stars welfare
1271 perhaps in a vain attempt to add an air of authenticity to the latest death hoax the phony story on the ersatz msnbc site claimed the death of axl rose remained unconfirmed
1271 its fake dude wrote the site mediaite in its story mocking the axl rose death hoax you can go ahead and confirm it
1271 the site gossip cop which specializes in debunking rumors about celebrities dead or alive was among the first to expose the fakery which apparently fooled numerous internet users with its convincing-looking url msnbcwebsite
1271 the awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the msnbcwebsite url which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories reported gossip cop enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than <number> times on social media like facebook again this is totally fake msnbcwebsite pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about macaulay culkin the phony culkin story is almost identical to the phony rose story dont believe any report coming from msnbcwebsite
1271 in addition to home alone star culkin and todays hogwash axl rose is dead prank other celebrities victimized by death hoaxes recently have included dog whisperer cesar millan <number>s brat pack actor judd nelson and tv incredible hulk star lou ferrigno
1271 while axl rose and his representatives have not confirmed that the paradise city crooner is actually still living and breathing but they probably dont need to but one thing is certain axl rose may be the latest but will certainly not be the last dead but-not-really celebrity to be the subject of a yet another tiresome online death hoax
1273 woburn mass ap a <number>-year-old shoebox-sized time capsule was removed thursday from the head of a lion statue where it had long sat hidden in plain sight atop one of boston 's most famous landmarks
1273 when the copper box was carefully pried open it revealed at least one mystery a red hardcover book with no visible title or markings the contents of the book and the rest of the items in the box will remain a mystery for a bit longer as they were deemed too fragile to remove immediately
1273 the time capsule 's presence at the old state house had only recently been confirmed the bostonian society which oversees the building had expected it to contain a potpourri of photographs and newspaper clippings from the period along with a missive to future generations penned by a group of boston journalists
1273 i 'm absolutely delighted by the conditions inside the box said brian lemay the society 's president noting little sign of mold or water damage historians had feared the contents could have been destroyed had the box been improperly sealed
1273 the time capsule was placed inside the lion 's head in <number> and then forgotten even as waves of tourists visited the building that once served as a fulcrum of british rule in the northern colonies and later as the first seat of massachusetts state government
1273 in <number> british soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protesters outside the building killing five in what came to be known as the boston massacre
1273 the society first learned of the possible existence of the time capsule three years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of samuel rogers a craftsman who had worked on renovations to the building and was believed to have placed the box in the lion 's head and catalogued its contents a <number> article from the boston globe surfaced later alluding to contents of a copper box which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence
1273 the box was removed thursday by robert shure president of skylight studios in suburban woburn where the copper and gold-leaf lion statue had been brought for refurbishing
1273 shure placed the box on a table and used a drill and other tools to cut it open the bright red book was the first object seen inside
1274 washington wjla  the white house intruder who jumped a fence and made it inside the white house just over a week ago overtook a secret service agent and managed to run into the east room which is often used for presidential addresses the washington post reported monday
1274 several sources gave the post a new account of the case involving omar gonzalez an iraq veteran said to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder the previous account from the secret service claimed gonzalez was quickly apprehended after he made it inside the front door to the white house but the post 's report indicates gonzalez made it much further inside than previously known the post report also provided first word that gonzalez who authorities said was armed with a knife actually overpowered a secret service agent before running throughout much of the main floor sources also told the post that an alarm box designed to alert guards to an intruder had apparently been muted which may have contributed to gonzalez being able to burst through the front door so easily the secret service declined to comment to the post because the security breach remains under ongoing investigation
1277 when apple unveiled its first smartwatch earlier this month the company told us a lot about its design customization options and the type of features we can expect what we did n't hear about however is the technology apple will use to power the watch
1277 cowen and company analyst timothy arcuri spoke with apple 's supply chain to learn that the apple watch will most likely come in two different storage capacities <number>gb and <number>gb arcuri revealed this information in a note to investors according to apple insider
1277 arcuri believes the <number>gb edition will be the more popular mainstream version noting that the <number>gb watch probably wo n't be the default configuration this means you 'll be able to store apps messages fitness data and other types of files and information directly on the watch
1277 that amount of storage space is fairly standard for smartwatches both samsung 's gear <number> and sony 's smartwatch <number> also come with <number>gb of storage space this means that if apple does release an <number>gb version it 'll offer twice as much storage as current smartwatches
1277 arcuri 's supply chain sources also said the wireless chip inside apple 's watch would come with a gps radio which is odd given that apple said its watch would need to be connected to an iphone to use gps data this chip will reportedly be similar to the wireless chip found inside the iphone <number>s arcuri wrote
1277 the apple watch wo n't be released until early <number> so we expect to learn more about it over the next several months

1280 would you pay five grand for the high-end luxury edition of the apple watch that 's the starting price that piper jaffray analyst gene munster sees in his crystal ball
1280 on march <number> apple is expected to finally unveil the finer details of its apple watch including the price tags and launch date the company 's first smartwatch will be available in three versions apple watch sport apple watch and apple watch edition apple has already revealed that the entry-level sport model will start at <number> in the us but the company has been mum about the prices of the other two models
1280 in an investors note released late monday munster said he expects that the price for the sport model could reach as high as <number> depending on different case and storage options the mid-tier apple watch could start at anywhere from <number> to <number> and likely will come closer to an average selling price of <number> according to munster but the top-of-the-line apple watch edition could break the bank starting at <number> and potentially reaching closer to <number> by factoring in high-end expensive bands
1280 that <number> price lines up with a projection from apple observer john gruber who forecast the cost of the high-end version last september
1280 apple is a latecomer to a smartwatch market already crowded with entries from samsung lg motorola microsoft sony pebble and other players apple 's product will be part smartwatch and part fitness and activity tracker a combination the company is counting on to bring in buyers but by offering the watch in a luxury edition apple is also presenting it as a piece of fine jewelry to further distinguish it from rival products
1280 munster remains bearish on apple watch sales estimating <number> million in unit sales this year compared with wall street forecasts of <number> million but the analyst believes next monday 's event will finally highlight the special features of the watch and start to excite the public
1280 apple will offer interchangeable bands for each of its watches a factor that will determine the ultimate price munster said he believes the elastomer bands for the apple watch sport will range in price from <number> to <number> leather bands could be priced from <number> to <number> steel bands could run around <number> and the gold bands for the higher-end edition may run into the thousands of dollars
1280 how might the three different versions of the watch play out in terms of sales munster said he expects the entry-level sport edition to account for around <number> percent of all units sold this year while the apple watch will contribute around <number> percent that leaves the luxury apple watch edition contributing pretty much nothing at least in terms of percentage
1280 the apple watch edition is the more difficult to predict but we believe that with the watch likely starting at <number> apple might sell around <number> units in cy<number> calendar year <number> of our total <number> million estimate munster said to put the <number>k units in perspective piper analyst erinn murphy in conjunction with industry estimates believes that rolex sells <number>-<number>k watches per year thus apple at <number>k in the first year would be about <number> percent the size of rolex we believe this is a reasonable potential first year size as high-end consumers weigh the power of the apple brand vs other luxury watches and the trade-off of quickly depreciating technology in an apple watch vs other more traditional luxury watches that may hold value better

1305 cuban dissidents and cuban-american media are reporting that havana is plagued with the most serious rumors in months that former dictator fidel castro has died after the one-year anniversary of castros last public appearance transpired without fanfare on thursday
1305 the rumors began to circulate almost immediately after president barack obama announced that the united states would yield major concessions to the cuban government in exchange for the freedom of usaid worker alan gross jailed for attempts to bring internet services to jewish cubans as fox news latino reports fidel castro made no public comments on the matter triggering a wave of rumors in cuban dissident media castro has previously commented on a number of current events including blaming the united states and the mossad the israeli intelligence service of creating the islamic state terrorist group in september
1305 one dissident blogger in particular yusnaby prez exacerbated rumors by writing about them in a spanish-language post titled has fidel died in which he detailed changes in behavior from neighborhood communists who had previously been loud and fervent in their displays of support for the castros particularly on january <number> the anniversary of the revolution
1305 this january <number>st my neighbor mercy did not hang her viva la revolucin sign as usual at the entrance to her house how strange it is the first year since i can remember that neither fidel nor my neighbors odious signwith soviet fontappears
1305 prez tweeted that almost immediately after publishing the blog post the cuban government shut down his entire page at least within cuba his twitter account appeared unscathed however where he posted images of cubans wearing american flag leggings after the announcement of president obamas concessions to the castros
1305 rumors strengthened this week however as the anniversary of castros last appearance approached news outlets in miami the de facto capital of the cuban diaspora reported this week that the cuban government had called for a press conference today to follow up castros year-long absence with an update many speculating that they would announce castros death the cuban foreign ministry denied that any such press conference was scheduled for today however or that they had any major news to break instead they noted that there was no record of an email or text message sent out to convene reporters as is customary
1305 but dissidents continue to report strange incidents that give fuel to the rumor that if not dead castro is close to death miami media professor carlos pealosa reported that rumors had not been abated by the cuban government message and that venezuelan president nicols maduro must be on his way to havana
1305 yusnaby prez also reports that there are strong rumors that ral castro called the socialist venezuelan president urgently to havana another alleged sign that castro has died
1305 maduro had traveled to china to ask the chinese government for financial aid as the venezuelan economy is collapsing under his socialist price controls and suffering due to the extremely low international prices of crude oil and despite the rumors venezuelan state media reported that he landed in iran today with no apparent emergencies to attend to on the western hemisphere nonetheless venezuelan opposition media are reporting that his departure from china was indicative enough of a route back to cuba

1339 tiger woods  agent responded monday to inflammatory allegations made by little-known pro dan olsen who said on the mad dog in the morning radio show last week that woods is serving a suspension for a failed drug test
1339 these claims are absolutely unequivocally and completely false agent mark steinberg said they are unsourced unverified and completely ridiculous
1339 on monday morning the pga tour responded to the claims
1339 there is no truth whatsoever to these claims we categorically deny these allegations said ty votaw executive vice president of the pga tour
1339 woods is on leave from the pga tour as he tries to sort out issues with his game especially with his chipping woods who said he would not return to the tour until he can compete with the best in the game missed the cut in the waste management phoenix open in his first tournament of the season shooting a career-high <number> in the process and then withdrew with a stiff back after <number> holes the following week in the farmers insurance open
1339 woods said his back problems are not the reason for his hiatus from the game nor are they related to the injuries that forced him to have back surgery last march <number>
1339 i ve heard that he 's suspended i heard he 's on a month 's suspension and it 's not it 's kind of a strong witness it 's a credible person that 's telling me this olsen said friday on the radio show well it 's not testosterone but it 's something else
1339 olsen also said woods was using untested equipment
1340 boko haram thinks all the truce talk is hilarious at least that is what it seems like judging from a video released friday to nigerian media that purported to show the terrorist groups leader abubakar shekau laughing off claims that it had reached a ceasefire with the government and that the more than <number> girls the group kidnapped six months ago were close to being released a lie shekau said we married them off they are in their marital homes he said chuckling according to cnn he then added that the girls converted to islam and have now memorized two chapters of the quran in fact the whole issue about the kidnapped girls has been long forgotten he added
1340 in the video shekau said he had no idea whom the supposed negotiator was who supposedly worked out a cease-fire deal with the government on behalf of the islamist group we will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him he said of the negotiator he also threatened to kill a captured german hostage who is always crying he added that the extremist group could hack him or slaughter him or shoot him reports the associated press
1340 throughout the rambling speech shekau who bristled with theatrical rage talked about everything from the islamic state to obscure nigerian politicians to a threat to eat the heart of infidels reports the wall street journal yet more than what he said the mere release of a video is bad news for president goodluck jonathan whose administration had touted the cease-fire on the campaign trail jonathan is expected to win a second term in february

1343 rumors of ebola turned out to be far more contagious than the virus itself this weekend as online media whipped up a feverish story later disproven of a suspected ebola case in kansas city
1343 after appearing on a local blog and a wichita television website saturday night the rumor went viral spreading to such national outlets as breitbartcom
1343 then on sunday afternoon a spokeswoman for research medical center issued a statement
1343 we have seen online reports that a patient at research medical center is suspected of having ebola these reports are inaccurate research medical center is caring for a patient who presented to our brookside campus emergency department however the patient does not have the symptom profile of ebola
1343 that was followed monday by a statement from the kansas city health department the health department has ruled out the presence of ebola in kansas city
1343 there was a social media frenzy about the possibility of ebola in kansas city said jeff hershberger a department spokesman were still exploring how this happened
1343 hospitals and the general public have been on edge since an ebola case was diagnosed last week at a hospital in dallas thomas eric duncan is in critical condition at texas health presbyterian hospital the hospitals failure to recognize that duncan may have had ebola during an earlier visit to its emergency room has heightened vigilance further
1343 details about what happened saturday in kansas city are still unclear but a feverish man was taken to research medical centers brookside campus on saturday night the man apparently was from nigeria a country that has had ebola cases but is not among the three african countries engulfed in the current epidemic
1343 the patients travel history and fever triggered them to look at things that included ebola hershberger said
1344 according to a new report from <number>to<number>mac a new macbook air is coming the new computer is alleged to have a<number>-inch screen but remain about the size of the <number>-inch model via reduced bezels on all sides possibly even cooler than that is the computer is said to be an actual thing not like the ipad pro we keep hearing about sources inside apple claim to have been hands-on with the new device which is also lighter than existing macbook airs
1344 aside from sporting a larger screen and lighter design there are several other interesting nuances here the new-look macbook is sporting a single usb type-c port which sounds silly but isnt
1344 the usb type-c port can handle things youve been relying on other ports to do for years like external monitors the new usb standard is also capable of charging so magsafes might be dead
1344 that also means no multiple usb ports sd card slot thunderbolt and you wont be able to natively charge and use an external monitor the natural assumption here is that apple will release some sort of hub alongside the new macbook air for those occasions when multitasking is necessary
1344 profilel-r-copy
1344 the trackpad is said to be a touch bigger than the existing macbook air models and get rid of the click but the keyboard has reportedly been minimized to accommodate the slimmer profile that means smaller keys closer together even though the keyboard is said to go edge-to-edge
1344 the report details the device as overall slimmer than the existing macbook air <number>-inch which sounds insane but a touch taller to accommodate the larger <number>-inch screen speaker grilles toward the top of the keyboard double as vents for the cpu too
1344 what news dont we get here retina sadly nothing in the report suggest well get a retina macbook air with the refresh fans of the dense apple screens wont find favor there but well all still marvel at the thin profile should this actually come to pass as reported

1346 the islamic state murderer dubbed jihadi john  has been named as mohammed emwazi from west london according to reports
1346 it is understood that he was known to british security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons
1346 a close friend of emwazi told the washington post i have no doubt that mohammed is jihadi john
1346 he was like a brother to me i am sure it is him
1346 downing street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services
1346 asked if david cameron was concerned about emwazi 's name being reported a no <number> spokeswoman said the prime minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of british citizens
1346 there is an ongoing investigation it is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep british people safe
1346 kuwaiti-born emwazi is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west london at times attending a mosque in greenwich
1346 he is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the university of westminster after which he started to become radicalised
1347 the apple watch might be water resistant according to comments reported by french site igen via appleinsider either that or it 's a misunderstanding and we do n't really know which apple ceo tim cook reportedly told employees at an apple store in berlin that he wears his apple watch everywhere even in the shower
1347 apple has not officially designated the apple watch as either water proof or water resistant if mr cook actually said he wears his in the shower it could indicate that apple will market the device as one or the other
1347 the problem is the report is hearsay and there could be some translation issues it might even have been a joke we have no context with which to judge this story so do n't invest too much in this rumor just yet
1347 in fact i personally doubt the device is water resistant or proof even if the device is sealed water and touch screens do n't typically work well together at all that would make it a coup for appleand if anyone could do it it is applebut i 'm not expecting a water resistant or proof apple watch based on this anecdote
1347 then there are the straps apple has plastic straps but i would n't want to run the metal ones or leather through a shower
1347 bah i do n't like this one at all
1347 in the meanwhile mr cook also reportedly says he charges his apple watch every night this is in keeping with the very rough comments from apple at the device 's unveiling in september at that time we were told apple had designed the watch to be charged at night though the company was unspecific about how long it would actually run
1347 so yeah i can believe that has n't changed but we still do n't have context for the comments

1352 jj abrams  heavily anticipated star wars the force awakens is currently slated to open in theaters this dec <number> <number> but if there 's truth to these recent release date rumors the sequel could be hitting the cinemas on an earlier schedule
1352 an article from the telegraph cited two separate unconfirmed reports from ikwiz and movie pilot indicating that instead of winter star wars vii might arrive in theaters this summer
1352 j j 's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the star wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching movie pilot wrote

1357 there 's an illustration being shared on facebook instagram and twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed <number> people near the offices of the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris earlier today
1357 while the image does have a touching message it 's almost certainly a fake  not created by banksy
1357 here 's the illustration that everyone is sharing
1357 mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a popular banksy  account on instagram the instagramcombanksy instagram is n't run by banksy at all and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists  rarely with any attribution
1357 search on facebook twitter and instagram and you 'll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official banksy pages the problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any facebook or twitter accounts he does however have one instagram account which was used during his recent trip to new york
1357 facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a facebook page for a banksy account with millions of likes after the artists pr representative denied that he had anything to do with it
1357 the instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles as well as the fake instagram and facebook accounts the administrators behind the banksy pages also run a youtube account that re-uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity
1357 here 's an example of a video posted by the fake banksy youtube account
1357 another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size the image uploaded to the fake banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work he would n't want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad

1368 new york city the new york police department will no longer arrest people for low-level marijuana possession according to people with knowledge of the citys drug strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity
1368 the nypd will issue violation summonses to people caught with marijuana instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a precinct the summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine

1372 seeking truth in stir of <number> missing stolen commercial airliners from the libyan airport during the fall of tripoli
1372 origins in early august <number> some north african bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the tripoli international airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by zintan militia forces earlier in the summer later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in western europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip by early september those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the united states under the guise of real news
1372 the use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in <number> makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again and despite denials from all sides the airlines who are not missing any planes the libyan transport ministry and the anti-government forces in control of the airport the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the <number> attacks
1372 however there have been no statements from the state department the department of defense homeland security or any other authority warning of stolen airliners the national threat level has not been raised algerian and moroccan military and air defense already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with libya would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft

1376 the department of homeland security definitively debunked the persistent right-wing media conspiracy theory that islamic state fighters have attempted to cross the us-mexico border saying the rumor is not supported by any credible intelligence and knocking the claim that the terrorists have been apprehended at the border as categorically false
1376 what began early this summer as an unsubstantiated claim from texas gov rick perry r that people that are coming across the us-mexico border from states like syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations a claim politifact texas rated pants on fire has morphed into a full-blown right-wing conspiracy theory conservative media and elected officials are hyping fears that members of the islamic state isis or isil terrorist group are utilizing the us-mexico border to enter the us and launch terrorist attacks a chorus that has only grown louder in the ensuing months to attack immigration reform
1376 in september rep jason chaffetz r-ut claimed to have seen information detailing four individuals trying to cross through the texas border who were apprehended at two different stations that do have ties to known terrorists organizations in the middle east a story subsequently hyped by fox news nearly a month later the number had jumped from four terrorists allegedly apprehended to <number>
1376 fox news  on the record provided a platform to rep duncan hunter r-ca who claimed to have first-hand knowledge of the terrorists crossing the border host greta van susteren replied to hunter 's allegations by asking do you have any information or any evidence that they are actually coming in the southern border now and hunter responded yes i know that at least <number> isis fighters have been caught coming across the mexican border in texas citing information he 'd received from border patrol agents
1376 but the right-wing talking point is categorically false according to the department of homeland security which oversees border security on october <number> dhs spokesperson marsha catron refuted the rumor that islamic state terrorists had crossed the us-mexico border telling the new republic
1376 the suggestion that individuals who have ties to isil have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground said dhs spokesperson marsha catron dhs continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border
1376 it remains to be seen whether dhs 's facts permeate the right-wing bubble after hearing the dhs statement sean hannity claimed on his radio program that the agency could not be trusted and suggested it may be lying

1377 every year theres been rumors about a so-called planetary alignment but theyre obviously fake
1377 the hoax originated in the <number>s when british astronomer patrick moore made it up telling his radio audience that the alignment would result in a gravitational pull that would make people lighter at <number> am local time
1377 as time magazine noted in a <number> article
1377 the british media have a unique affinity for pulling april fools pranks matched only by the british publics unique ability to fall for them on april <number> <number> bbc radio <number> astronomer sir patrick moore gave listeners some bunk about how at <number> am pluto and jupiter would align in such a way as to temporarily reduce earths gravity moore told listeners to jump at exactly that time to experience the once-in-a-lifetime effect at <number> callers flooded the lines eager to describe how they had briefly floated news that moore had played them no doubt brought everyone crashing back to earth
1377 a few days ago fake news website daily buzz live posted a variation of the hoax which generated tens of thousands of facebook shares in a short time it reads
1377 strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today but nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on january <number> <number>
1377 according to british astronomer patrick moore at exactly <number> pst am on january <number>th pluto will pass directly behind jupiter in relation to earth this rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull temporarily counteracting the earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless moore calls this the jovian-plutonian gravitational effect

1383 the former pricewaterhousecoopers employee who says comcast got him fired from his job set an oct <number> deadline for the company to respond to his demands of a full apology and a monetary settlement and got a half-assed apology instead two days after the deadline passed he stuck to his word and filed a lawsuit
1383 conal orourke is going after comcast and its controller lawrence salva for defamation and arguing the company violated federal regulations with its poor service and overbilling
1383 in his complaint orourke alleges that salva a former partner at pwc called up an executive at pwc 's philadelphia office and used comcast 's leverage as a major client to have orourke investigated for ethics violations and ultimately fired
1383 orourke says comcast and salva defamed him by telling his employer he threw pnc 's name around on the phone in an attempt to get his comcast service issues resolvedhe claims he never told anyone at comcast who he worked for and he wants comcast to release tapes and emails from his interactions with the controller 's office prove it
1383 oh and about those service issues orourke 's complaint also argues comcast 's mistreatment of him as a customer violated the cable communications policy act and lists some particularly egregious examples
1383 comcast habitually misspelled mr orourke 's name as mr okourke making it difficult for him to receive his comcast bills in a timely fashion because the postal service would fail to deliver them ultimately mr orourke convinced the postal service to deliver mail to him that was addressed to mr okourke after he was unable to convince comcast to even correct the spelling of his name
1383 in addition to comcast 's continual failure to address mr orourke 's billing issues in late november or early december of <number> when mr orourke was out of town comcast shipped mr orourke twelve random pieces of comcast equipment comcast then proceeded to charge mr orourke almost <number> in fees for equipment that he had neither requested nor wanted
1383 when he tried to get help with these issues he says comcast sent him to collections that 's when he took his complaint directly to the controller and allegedly lost his job as a result he says he never received a single correct bill in the entire year he was a comcast customer
1383 although orourke originally said he would sue to get his job back the complaint simply asks for legal fees and damagesie the lost wages from the six months he 's been unemployedand an injunction stopping the worst company in america from overbilling customers

1417 for the last few weeks the general public has assumed that tiger woods hasnt been playing on tour because of his back and a dog shit golf game but pga tour golfer dan olsen dont worry i havent heard of him before either is saying thats simply not the case olsen went on record during a radio interview with <number> wvfns david mad dog demarco claiming his sources are telling him that tiger woods is currently serving a one month suspension for failing a drug test later in the interview olsen says his sources are tour players that are exempt
1417 per olsens interview with <number> wvfn
1417 i heard hes on a month suspension and its kind of a strong witness a credible person thats telling me this its not testosterone but its something else i think when it is all said and done he is going to surpass lance armstrong withainfamy
1417 olsen didnt stop at peds he even goes as far as claiming tiger woods has allegedly been using questionable golf balls since the late <number>s so questionable in fact that nike has paid pga tour staff to pick up all the balls so no one gets the balls
1417 tiger hes got some problems now one of the big problems nikes been giving tiger a ball that i would almost bet hasnt been testedrory played it too remember when rory signed the nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year he was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too so if you go to tour events nike pays them pays the tour staff and the range staff they pay them to get all those balls back thats why tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away he played a ball that nobody else could play
1417 i have personally seen rory mcilroy throw his golf balls into the stands so i dont know how valid this ball claim is but wow dan olsen must have very few fucks left to give if hes publicly calling out tiger woods as a cheater on multiple levels
1417 thanks to brobible writer and pga tour caddie pinot pete for getting this interview on our radar and while pinot pete could not corroborate olsens claim nor would he probably want to because lawsuits he did say ive known dan olsen for <number> years and in all that time ive never known him to stretch the truth so theres that

1420 the apple watch is the most buzzed about wearable to hit the market in a long time and not all of the buzz is good we ve shared some of th earlier rumblings about the apple watch 's short battery life now we are hearing news of a new feature called power reserve which could be a battery-saving mode that lets the apple watch run on low energy while only displaying the time
1420 the apple watch 's battery life is expected to only last a day this puts it at the bottom of the pack for ios smartwatches even with a power reserve function the battery is significantly lagging behind the pebble time 's seven day battery life even before wearables came on the scene not everyone is diligent about plugging in their smartphones overnight one of the most frustrating things in the world is a dead battery when you need to check your email text or actually make a call
1420 if the expected battery life is only one day then we must consider what happens with higher than average usage imagine if dynamic and draining apps are engaged then the battery has the possibility of lasting only until midday this means that the user will have to take his watch off to charge itthe allure of a wearable is its instant notifications while your phone is tucked away in your pocket if the apple watch is n't on your wrist will you be drawn to look at the notifications
1420 can the new consumers get used to plugging in every night the power reserve feature sounds like it may revert the smartwatch back to an ordinary time piece to save battery life it 's still better than a running out of juice without a charge a dead apple watch is n't even a watch it 's just an expensive bracelet perhaps the short battery life will be overshadowed by the army of apps and developers apple has at its disposal we 'll let you know all the emerging details leading up to apple 's big event on march <number>th <number>

1425 citing an anonymous source the french website igenfr reports that stainless steel versions of the apple watch will retail for <number> while the gold models may retail for as high as <number>
1425 featured resource
1425 presented by scribe software <number> best practices for integrating data data integration is often underestimated and poorly implemented taking time and resources yet it learn more apple of course has been rather quiet on apple watch pricing aside from indicating that lower-tier pricing will begin at <number> for the apple watch sport models that being the case a <number> bump for stainless steel models is n't outside the realm of reason
1425 see also the many looks of the apple watch
1425 interestingly igenfr also relays that apple may still be trying to push for a release before valentine 's day this however is at odds with a previous report claiming that apple is planning to release its highly anticipated wearable device this spring

1436 users on twitter and facebook this week are saying parts of texas are now under sharia law or islamic law
1436 the whole thing appears to be an unfounded rumor that was twisted around when conservative news website breitbart published an article that says islamic tribunal confirmed in texas attorney claims its voluntary 
1436 some users and other blogs went along with the story but apparently misinterpreted its premise
1436 the article reads
1436 breitbart texas spoke with one of the judges dr taher el-badawi he said the tribunal operates under sharia law as a form of non-binding dispute resolution el-badawi said their organization is a tribunal not arbitration a tribunal is defined by meriam-websters dictionary as a court or forum of justice the four islamic attorneys call themselves judges not arbitrators
1436 el-badawi said the tribunal follows sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters he said they also resolve workplace disputes
1436 in matters of divorce el-badawi said that while participation in the tribunal is voluntary a married couple can not be considered divorced by the islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal he compared their divorce known as talaq as something similar to the catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage
1436 according to the islamic tribunals website it appears to deal mainly with divorce however people apparently thought the organization was trying to interpret a saudi arabian or isis-style version of sharia law complete with executions restrictions on women and other forms of punishment
1436 the islamic tribunal on its website or in the breitbart report never said it was trying to overrule existing federal state or local laws and replace it with its interpretation of sharia law

1455 a report on thursday claims the upcoming apple watch boasts a mysterious data connection port previously undisclosed by apple that is currently being used for diagnostics and testing
1455 according to techcrunch the port features six brass contact dots and is positioned inside the bottom groove designed to accept apple 's aftermarket straps technically a six-contact connector is similar to apple 's lightning protocol which currently uses six of its eight leads for charging and data transfer
1455 it is not clear if the port will be included when apple watch hits store shelves but sources inside apple have confirmed its existence on what the publication believes are shipping versions of the device
1455 a source said the port currently plays a role in diagnostics but points out that it could be used as a connection point for accessories in the future techcrunch speculates that such a data port could be used as a means to facilitate feature expansion perhaps smart bands that extend battery life or tack on gps and other sensing capabilities
1455 smartwatch maker pebble recently revealed a similar program for its new pebble time series dubbed smartstraps the initiative is an open platform that will let accessory makers build hardware like gps or heart rate monitoring
1455 there are currently no rumors suggesting apple plans to market such accessories but the port 's existence hints at interesting expansion possibilities assuming it ships as part of apple 's final design for example an expansion port could extend the watch 's lifecycle by offering users a road to upgrade features instead of purchasing a new device every year this would be especially helpful for buyers looking at expensive gold apple watch edition models

1477 we ve heard rumors for some time that apple 's been less than pleased with the purported battery life of its upcoming apple watch and now it looks as though it has plenty of reason to be worried according to a new report from <number> to <number> mac the apple watch the battery is looking at just <number> to <number> hours of active application use before it dies yeesh
1477 according to <number> to <number> mac 's report while apple along with everyone else who 's had their eyes on one was hoping its watch would last for at least a full day on a single charge it 's had to significantly change its tune thanks to the power-sucking retina screen and a<number> processor
1477 as of <number> apple wanted the watch to provide roughly <number> to <number> hours of active application use versus <number> hours of combined activepassive use <number> days of pure standby time or <number> days if left in a sleeping mode sources however say that apple will only likely achieve approximately <number>-<number> days in either the standby or low-power modes
1477 but if you 're hoping to use the apple watch for fitness tracking there is sort of better news apple expects to see better battery life when using the watch 's fitness tracking software which is targeted for nearly <number> hours of straight exercise tracking on a single charge which sure is better than the two-and-a-half hours you 'd get under normal heavy use but there 's no way this is going to be tracking more than the lone workout
1477 as a point of comparison the moto <number> easily lasts a full day of mixed-use our own eric limer 's watch still had a little under half of its battery left after about <number>-hours of wear even the samsung gear s which is essentially a full-fledged phone for your wrist can go a full day easy and of course the pebble smartwach which is admittedly a very different beast can last close to a full week on a single charge
1477 still while these numbers certainly seem awful most people probably are n't going to be browsing facebook and playing games on their wrist four hours apple expects most people to be wearing the watch passively for the majority of the day but while they were originally shooting for about <number> hours of mixed usage <number> to <number> mac 's sources say that apple no longer thinks it can even hit thatat least not in this first generation
1477 we ve reached out to apple for comment and will update as soon as we hear back <number> to <number> mac

1491 satirical news site huzlerscom has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week taking in numerous facebook and twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they 're going to be up to during the six days of darkness

1500 tonight finally espn is going to have an in-depth discussion on the nfl 's domestic violence problem the discussion will feature the opinions of up to <number> men and zero women in a remarkable showing of the exact flavor of dumb meathead that espn is so adept at that it should trademark

1500 understandably this has upset many people with brains that they use to think rather than promote espn programming including esquire 's ben collins collins has had about enough of espn 's blatant nfl defense he argues that espn 's pre-monday night football man only domestic violence discussion is even more insidious when you consider just how pathetically cowardly and craven the network is

1500 you will not hear these words because espn has a <number> billion broadcasting agreement with the nfl you will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both espn and the nfl can make
1500 you will not hear these words because espn is not a company in the business of journalism it is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient timely information to drive interest in future programming
1500 you will not hear these words because espn has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence what an excellent way for espn and the nfl to lead into october domestic violence awareness month
1500 update espn publicist josh krulewitz tells our sister site deadspin that despite esquire 's report from the <number>th tonight 's programming was never going to be a panel on domestic violence krulewitz says it 's a regular episode of countdown hosted by suzy kolber

1508 the university uses first-year in its admissions process because the types of students coming into college are not all traditional students who have graduated from high school
1508 at almost every college admissions is moving to this term because it encompasses traditional students and also includes transfers spring admits gap semester students part-time students and non-traditional age students anderson said it describes people spending their first year at elon
1508 anderson explained that the term isnt elons alone duke university the university of north carolina system and high point all use first-year on their admissions websites they all refer to the first year experience the us news and world report publishes rankings for the schools with the best first-year experience programming
1508 while there is no official policy on the word first-year blair foreman said her orientation leader always called the group just that and most of her professors use the term as well she understands why the university would use it in place of freshman but is not offended by the word

1513 apparently apples initial plans were to use samsungs nand flash for the iphone <number> but because the two companies have failed to agree on the prices apple has decided to use toshibas tlc nand flash in the <number> gb iphone <number> and various other components manufactured by sk hynix toshiba and sandisk on the <number> gb variant however since the tlc nand flash on the <number> and <number> gb iphone <number> and <number> plus proved to cause headaches sources say that apple might strike a deal with samsung in order to supply both the nand flash and the dram of future-to-be-manufactured iphone <number> units in addition some industry insiders speculate that both companies are currently jointly developing communications chips for the next-gen iphone

1515 us intelligence is concerned they could be utilized in a <number>-style attack gertz said of the planes if they dont use them in suicide attacks they could also be used to transport some of these islamist groups to expand their reach
1515 it seems like the state department the obama administration is trying to play down these reports but the people i talked to were fairly concerned about them gertz said again they are trying to locate these jets i dont think the cia has a full handle on where all of the aircraft from the airlines were there are a number of airports in the region that are within close distance to tripoli international so theyre obviously looking at these places and trying to get a count of how many aircraft are there
1515 when co-host brian wilson asked specifics with regard to how gertzs sources responded to the reports of the missing jets by saying the cant confirm the reports gertz explained that cant confirm in this context was not meant as a denial but theyre trying to play down by saying well we cant confirm them thats kind of bureaucrat speak within the united states government
1515 you have to understand the politics of libya right now gertz saidyou have a congressional inquiry spinning up to look at the <number> terrorist attack at the diplomatic compound in benghazi so that would be my only speculation as to why theyre playing it down

1518 heres an important heads-up if you keep documents in your icloud drive dont use ios <number>s reset all settings option it could delete files stored in the cloud
1518 the bug was discovered by macrumors who found that selecting the reset all settings option from settings in ios <number> will erase iwork-related files in icloud drive
1518 this is not the way its supposed to work when you reset an iphone or ipads settings ios will even tell you that no data or media will be deleted but in ios <number> this isnt working as intended
1518 the good news is if you dont use iwork you dont have anything to fear the deleted files bug seems to be specific to iwork documents but you should still probably stay clear of the reset all settings option until apple gets this sorted out better safe than sorry

1524 the apple watch is the catalyst to ignite the global smartwatch market said strategy analytics executive director neil mawston apples famous brand loyal fan base deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its watch
1524 late last week apple announced a special spring forward event scheduled to take place on monday and expected to focus primarily on the upcoming apple watch apple will likely share details about the wearable that have so far been the focus of a barrage of rumors including expected retail pricing expected battery life and accessories apple ceo tim cook recently revealed that development of the wearable is right on track and that the apple watch will go on sale in april

1528 it would have been pretty embarrassing for batman the ultimate crime fighter
1528 but thankfully rumors that caped crusader 's wheels had been stolen from beneath his nose proved to be untrue
1528 the famous batmobile was spotted cruising detroit as filming continues of batman vs superman dawn of justice
1528 scroll down for video
1528 spotted the batmobile was seen cruising the set of batman vs superman dawn of justice last week
1528 reports began to surface online that the iconic vehicle had gone missing presumed pinched from the warner brother 's set two weeks ago
1528 but according to the detroit free press there had been no such crime
1528 detroit police spokesman sgt michael woody said the force had spoken with the producers of the movie to confirm all was well
1528 the batmobile is safe in the batcave where it belongs  sgt woody told the newspaper
1529 rumors have hit social media that the batmobile has been stolen from the batman v superman dawn of justice set in detroit while on the face of it the idea that someone could actually make off with a batmobile from the heavily-secured set seem somewhat ludicrous the local michigan media seems to be taking the reports seriously enough that the police department has been contacted to look into it
1529 cbs detroit notes in their report does this person if the rumor is true we dont know how credible the source is think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice wwj<number> tweets was the batmobile stolen in hashtagzz unconfirmed rumors are swirling and police tell wwj they 'll look into it
1529 of course its a little unclear from the tweet if the police department is actually looking into the disappearance of the batmobile or is just looking into the source of the unconfirmed rumors most sites seem to be pointing to bleeding cool as the source of the rumors which they report as having heard from sources in detroit
1529 batman v superman dawn of justice is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on march <number> <number>

1531 the frightening story about a spider that reportedly burrowed through an australian mans surgery scar and left a disturbing red trail up his stomach might not be a completely accurate account according to some arachnid experts
1531 the stomach selfie of <number>-year-old dylan thomas has gone viral around the globe after doctors at bali international medical center apparently figured out his mystery condition was caused by a spider living under his skin for three days
1531 well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider thats been living inside of me for the last <number> days managed to get it out luckily he wrote on facebook havent felt so violated in my life before just glad its all over
1531 but the whole thing could have been caused by a different organism or be a complete fake according to some
1531 i think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible christopher buddle associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences told io<number> simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented
1531 another scientist expressed skepticism over the situation as well
1531 in general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that dr charles griswold schlinger curator of arachnology emeritus at the california academy of sciences told io<number>
1531 while another organism perhaps a tick or mite could possibly be associated with something like this buddle said according to io<number> it at least was certainly not a spider
1531 thomas did not immediately respond to request for comment from theblaze

1534 hbo is in talks with apple to make apple tv one of the launch partners for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month hbo and streaming partner major league baseball advanced media are working to have the standalone service called hbo now ready to launch in april in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of game of thrones according to sources familiar with their plans
1534 when it launches consumers will be able to subscribe to hbo now directly from hbo for the first time rather than through a cable satellite or telco tv distributor such as comcast or verizon the retail price is expected to be <number> a month when purchased directly from hbo or about the that consumers pay when they order hbo through their cable satellite or telco provider
1534 with hbo now hbos corporate parent time warner inc is looking to a whole new generation of distributors for hbo such as apple tv roku xbox playstation amazon and others to help market the service to an estimated <number> million us broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable tv bundle ceo jeff bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the <number> million cable tv subscribers who do not subscribe to hbo but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online
1534 hbos over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest chink yet in the so-called cable bundle where consumers are required to buy packages of channels some of which they may never watch one study claimed the service would lead to a <number> percent drop in pay tv subscribers as users opt of cable and opt-in to hbo now
1534 but some cable providers such as cablevision and cox communications have expressed interest in bundling hbo now with broadband for their own subscribers who dont get cable tv
1534 apple has been most aggressive in courting hbo in a bid to add the service to apple tv sources say apple tv already carries hbo go for current hbo subscribers but it may add a second app for hbo now apple has spent the last several years negotiating for the rights to offer their own linear tv package in the meantime hbo now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of apple tv
1534 while hbo has not confirmed a launch date for hbo now internally the target is an april launch in time for the april <number> debut of game of thrones thats an aggressive timeframe for major league baseball advanced media which is building the back-end along with a new front-end separate from hbo go hbo is taking care not to launch hbo now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued hbo go during last fall 's debut of game of thrones
1534 the launch of hbo now will be a milestone for time warners premium tv channel which has for most of its <number>-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels the web service will allow hbo to sign on a new group of distribution partners which it sees as no different than when it added satellite tv and later telcos like verizon and att
1534 each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for hbo and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from <number> to <number> a month most see hbo as a retention device those that subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers hbo and time warner declined to comment

1564 at least two experts are questioning the authenticity of an audio file that is purported to have captured the gunshots that killed <number>-year-old michael brown in ferguson missouri earlier this month
1564 cnn law enforcement analyst tom fuentes and former los angeles police officer david klinger both said wednesday morning that they initially felt the recording alleged to reveal the sequence of shots fired by officer darren wilson was a hoax according to mediaite
1564 ive told your producers that for all i know this is something that one of howard sterns punk people have been doing i dont have a high degree of confidence in it klinger said on cnns new day i look at this and my first inclination is that someone is trying to punk cnn
1564 he cited the fact that the clip emerged two weeks after the shooting as well as the curious words being voiced by a man in the audio as reasons why he doubted its authenticity though he said he remains open to seeing whether an investigation finds it legitimate
1564 a mans voice can be heard in the audio telling a woman you are pretty youre so fine just going over some of your videos how could i forget the context of the remarks is unclear though purported gunshots can be heard in the background
1564 and klinger wasnt alone in his skepticism fuentes also said that he has qualms over the authenticity of the audio
1564 when i heard this yesterday i thought the exact same thing its a hoax but maybe not maybe theyll be able to authenticate it he said
1564 fuentes said that the fbis investigation will likely include engineers at quantico examining the audio to see if there was any dubbing and to examine whether the complete tape was delivered to cnn mediaite reported

1572 multiple users of anonymous web browser tor have reported that comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software
1572 according to a report on deepdotweb comcast customer representatives have branded tor illegal and told customers that using it is against the company 's policies
1572 tor is a type of web browser that in theory makes all your internet activity private the software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage up to <number> million people use the browser which became especially popular after edward snowden leaked information showing that the nsa was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens prior to that tor had been popular among people transacting business on silk road the online market for drugs and hitmen
1572 the problem is that downloading or using tor itself is n't illegal plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private without letting others know what they were looking at but tor has been pretty popular with criminals
1572 comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an illegal service one comcast representative identified only as kelly warned a customer over his use of tor software deepdotweb reports
1572 users who try to use anonymity or cover themselves up on the internet are usually doing things that arent so-to-speak legal we have the right to terminate fine or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules do you have any other questions thank you for contacting comcast have a great day

1573 astronomers including experts at nasa have questioned whether the blast and crater reported earlier this week outside the nicaraguan capital were actually the product of a meteorite
1573 initial reports including information issued by the nicaraguan government suggested a piece of space rock broke off from a larger asteroid passing between the earth and its moon  creating a sizable crater measuring roughly <number> feet across near managua 's international airport
1573 but nasa officials say the lack of eyewitness accounts raises doubts about that scenario plus astronomers say the timeline does n't work out
1573 this event was separated by <number> hours from the close earth approach of <number> rc so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated nasa asteroid expert don yeomans told national geographic there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact
1573 yeomans  doubts are shared by bill cooke head of nasa 's meteoroid environment office cooke says the energy needed to create such a crater would be the equivalent of a single ton of dynamite
1573 for something to produce a hole in the ground that big it would have generated a very bright fireball and nothing was reported despite the population cooke told sci-tech today so i 'm very skeptical
1573 nicaraguan officials are apparently now quite confused themselves and have asked the us to help sort the whole thing out
1573 considering the small amount of experience and the lack of research means nicaragua desires to request the good offices of the us embassy to get the support of the us geological survey the country 's deputy foreign minister orlando gomez wrote in a letter to the us ambassador in managua phyllis powers
1573 it 's not yet clear whether the us will provide investigative assistance  or what the assistance would look like

1585 apple was light on technical specifications in announcing its forthcoming watch earlier this month but one analyst has checked with the company 's supply chain to find component makers expect the final shipping product to include <number> megabytes of ram and a mainstream version with <number> gigabytes of internal storage
1585 the details were reported in a new research note to investors on monday by timothy arcuri of cowen and company the note which was provided to appleinsider claims that the <number> megabytes of mobile dram will likely be supplied by samsung hynix and micron
1585 as for the internal storage arcuri believes apple may offer an <number>-gigabyte version of the watch in addition to the standard <number>-gigabyte version but he said the larger-capacity option will not likely be the default configuration he expects the memory will come from most major nand suppliers
1585 as for other internal components arcuri said he expects the apple watch to feature a wireless combination chip similar to the broadcom bcm<number> found in the iphone <number>s interestingly that chip includes a gps radio which arcuri admitted is somewhat at odds with apple 's announcement where the company said the watch will require being tethered to an iphone in order to offer gps data

1586 two friends have a <number>-year-old mcdonalds quarter pounder that theyve keep safe for another friend for the past two decades it was <number> years ago when the friend asked the two to pick up the quarter pounder for him while they were at the local mcdonalds but he never showed up to eat the burger according to <number> news on feb <number>
1586 a <number>-year-old burger a mcdonald 's quarter pounder with cheese looks pretty much the same as a new quarter pounder looks today youtube screen shot it became a joke over the next few weeks when the friend still hadnt claimed the burger the buddies told him they 'd keep it safe for him then that ran into months and now decades later the quarter pounder is unwrapped and shared on a local news show the two australian buddies casey dean and eduard nitz were only <number> and <number> at the time they purchased the quarter pounder with cheese for their friend
1586 according to the sidney daily telegraph dean states that he is pretty sure that this burger is the oldest burger in the world while folks might store wine to age for <number> years ground beef is not something you would eat after being left out a few hours never mind decades
1586 dean and nitz recently appeared on the tv show the project with their antiquated mcdonalds quarter pounder and it didnt look as one might expect a <number>-year-old burger to look like the burger and bread didnt sport any mold discoloration or even a bad smell it looked almost identical to a mcdonald 's burger just purchased today
1586 this quarter pounder has now taken on a life of its own with a new facebook page that asks can this burger get more likes than kanye west it got <number> likes in just the first day it materialized
1586 the two aussie buddies were about to take a bite of the very old burger in the name of charity but the shows host prompted them to put it down and skip this decades-old offering the host protested and shared some common sense with the two friends and they obliged
1586 if the two buddies had eaten the old burger chances are they would later break out in a fight as to who would use the bathroom first they would most likely spend the remainder of the day hanging around the toilet bowl from eating meat that is so old

1594 update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just <number> hours or so before the close flyby of <number>-m asteroid <number> rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space
1594 according to the nicaraguan news site el<number>digitalcom an explosion occurred around <number> pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over <number> metres <number> feet wide and about <number> metres <number> feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the city 's international airport and just south of the pan-american highway
1594 the video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion while the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaragua 's institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agency 's seismic instruments
1594 we are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence france-presse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound
1594 however while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just do n't add up
1594 a <number>-metre wide asteroid named <number> rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a <number>-hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events it 's not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over <number> known near-earth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we have n't detected and likely wo n't because they 're too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles  which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulder-like shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs  with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader   possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs  is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground
1594 however just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another does n't mean that they are related we saw this back in mid-february <number> when we were watching asteroid <number> da<number> sweep by earth and suddenly a <number>-m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence
1594 according to nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event a meteorite without the meteor
1594 an interesting fact about this supposed impact  is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around <number> kilometres per second or over <number> kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead

1660 years ago i had a job in china where i evaluated the spoken english of college students one bright young woman introduced herself to me with her chinese name then she added you can call me easy  that 's my english name

1660 food is very hit or miss and usually miss one of the issues here is that food names can be very  suggestive

1680 the apple watch reveal back in september was big on excitement but short on details among those things that apple failed to mention was whether or not cupertinos new smartwatch will be able to withstand liquids making it suitable for say swimming or washing the dishes
1680 while we still dont have a final definitive answer on what is and is not advisable with the apple watch tim cook shed a bit of light on the mystery during a qa session with staff at the kurfrstendamm apple store in berlin germany where he is currently visiting cook said that that he wears his apple watch even in the shower
1680 this is in contrast with what we had previously heard courtesy of tech journalist david pogue who after a private briefing with apple advised readers that sweating while wearing the apple watch wearing it in the rain washing your hands or cooking with it is fine take it off before the swim or get in the shower though
1680 as much as we respect pogue youd have to say that when it comes to apple advice cook trumps pogue

1680 cook talked about some of the possible applications of the apple watch including monitoring auctions on ebay or else accessing hotel rooms in a way similar to existing apps for the iphone
1680 answering a question from a visually impaired employee he said that the apple watch will have more accessibility features added over time although it sounds like these features will be limited at first
1680 no price tariff was given for the device but cook confirmed that apple will begin marketing the device in april in what sounds like an amusing moment cook sidestepped the question of whether retail staff could have all have an apple watch to more easily show customers by saying that it is a good idea and that he would consider it
1680 cook also spoke about his efforts to improve working conditions in china and lamented the fact that the media often choose to paint apple in a bad light in this regard cook said that apple is trying to ensure that there is no abuse of employees on the supply chain and that they work fairer numbers of hours

1690 a canadian-israeli woman who has joined the ranks of the kurdish militias fighting islamic state in northern syria has been taken captive by isis fighters blogs and islamist websites thought to be close to the militant group reported
1690 a blog considered to be one of the islamic state 's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the kurds have been captured among them gill rosenberg according to the report prior to their capture islamic state fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against kurdish outposts killing some and capturing many others
1690 according to israel radio kurdish sources denied the reports saying rosenberg was n't in the area when it was attacked
1690 gill rosenberg <number> a resident of tel aviv joined the kurdish troops against islamic state in northern syria earlier this month according to reports rosenberg said she had contacted kurdish fighters over the internet before traveling through iraq to train at one of their camps on the syrian border

1690 after me
1692 they havent verified that the recording is what it claims to be but with competition for this story among the media so ferocious go figure that theyd choose to put it on the air and worry about authenticity later as of last night the fbi was investigating between the guys ip and the fact that the video file is presumably timestamped i assume theyll be able to verify or debunk it quickly it could be a prank the man who recorded it seems to be er enjoying a video chat while it happened but what hes caught saying is tame if you were going to prank cnn by getting them to air something sexually explicit in the name of reporting news youd be more explicit than this no
1692 if its authentic it tells us how many shots were fired the mans attorney tells don lemon she hears <number> shots i hear <number> a forensic examiner who listened to the tape told cnn he heard at least <number> six shots followed by a pause followed by four more the autopsy report from the familys forensic pathologist claims brown was hit at least six times all from the front that means that he was hit at least twice in the first flurry of six shots heard here and furthermore that he was facing wilson at some point during that flurry its bizarre to me that brown would have turned back to face a man who was still in the process of firing at him at fairly close range but i dont know what other conclusion can be drawn based on what we know the fact that brown had apparently been wounded before the fateful pause during which he either rushed wilson or tried to surrender is also important the prosecution will argue that wilson having already drawn blood should have realized that a weakened brown was no longer as much of a physical threat wilson will argue that he felt threatened precisely because brown allegedly kept coming after he was wounded a man strong enough to take two shots and angry enough about it to advance on a cop with a gun was lethally dangerous hell say
1692 heres how browns friend dorian johnson described what happened to them
1692 now in line with the officers drivers side door they could see the officers face they heard him say something to the effect of whatd you say at the same time johnson says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into brown and bounced closed johnson says the officer with his left hand grabbed brown by the neck
1692 at that moment johnson says he fixed his gaze on the officer to see if he was pulling a stun gun or a real gun thats when he saw the muzzle of the officers gun
1692 i seen the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend he said he had it pointed at him and said ill shoot one more time
1692 a second later johnson said he heard the first shot go off

1700 my wrists and i have had a troubled relationship since last week
1700 ever since apple revealed its vast array of watches my lower forearms have looked up at me and hissed well you 're going to leave us naked
1700 so i spent some time yesterday browsing apple 's site and perusing all the different types of watches that will soon be available
1700 the fancier model  the so-called apple watch edition  does look relatively lovely on tiny female forms but how much might it cost all tim cook offered last week was that the watches  the cheapest presumably being the sporty ones you 'll sweat all over  will start at <number>
1700 then along comes influential apple observer john gruber to insert a little informed perspective
1700 apple watch is not a product from a tech company and it will not be understood at all by the tech world he said
1700 this incites a kaleidoscope of optimism for those who find tech minds frightfully insular for gruber the higher-end watches  the apple watch made of stainless steel and the watch edition adorned with <number>-karat gold  will be competing directly with fancy watches
1700 what they will offer is a hopefully gorgeous watch with some fancy gizmos attached
1700 it 's a persuasive concept one that makes your standard rolexy thing a klutzy lump of gold that can merely tell the time and make you look like something of a exhibitionist half-wit
1702 apple crushed its introduction of the apple watch yesterday in cupertino but while kevin lynch and jony were waxing poetic about the design of watch and its revolutionary ui there was one feature everyone steered clear of battery life
1702 other than introducing the new inductive charging cable apple was mum on how long its timepiece will stay charged according to a report from recode thats because apple is still trying to improve it ahead of the early <number> release but sources say apple watch battery life currently last about a day and will require nightly charging
1702 apple staff in the hands-on area after the show also wouldnt provide battery life estimations either but apple pr spokeswoman nat kerris told recode it should last you throughout the day
1702 theres a lot of new technology packed into apple watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day we anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our magsafe technology and inductive charging
1702 barely squeaking out <number> hours of use will surely be a disappointment for some users but its on par with most other smartwatches on the market no word on if the two different sizes will have different battery life as well the apple watch is expected to go on sale in early <number> at an introductory price of <number> while the sport and edition models are expected to cost more

1708 word that durex was rolling out a pumpkin-spice-flavored condom swept through social media over the weekend

1715 a new piece of audio has emerged that allegedly is a recording of the exact moment when officer darren wilson fatally shot unarmed teen michael brown on aug <number> six shots can be heard in rapid succession followed by a brief pause before four more shots are fired
1715 according to the new york daily news the audio which surfaced monday was recorded by a ferguson mo resident who can be heard on the tape talking with a woman when gunfire erupts in the background
1715 cnn aired the tape monday but was unable to independently verify its authenticity if the audio is from the exact moment when brown was shot then the gunfire heard on the tape clearly reveals that the officer paused before firing more shots
1715 that was what caught my attention initially said lopa blumenthal a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording it shows a point of contemplation
1715 witnesses have told both police and news stations that brown <number> was unarmed and running away with his hands up when wilson began shooting an independent autopsy indicates that brown was hit at least six times four in his arm and twice in the head
1715 the daily news notes that if the audio is verified the pause in firing could add weight to witnesses  claims
1718 dan olsen a former-ish pga golfer went on the game <number> ams mad dog in the morning on friday and lobbed some grenades at tiger woods
1718 ive heard that hes suspended said olsen ive heard that hes on a month suspension and its kind of a strong witness its a credible person thats telling me this its not testosterone but its something else i think when its all said and done that hes gon na surpass lance armstrong with infamy
1718 olsen also accused woods of using shady golf balls implied that there would be an institutional cover-up because the pga needs to market tiger and insinuated that hes faking his back injury his backs not hurt olsen said he was limping and he was faking worse than ive ever seen him fake
1718 espn obtained comment from the pga and tiger woods agent
1718 ty votaw the executive vice president of the pga tour denied any of the claims brought forth by olsen there is no truth whatsoever to these claims votaw said we categorically deny these allegations
1718 the tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters woods said on feb <number> that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the farmers insurance open over the past year woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the <number> in the world these claims are absolutely unequivocally and completely false said woods agent mark steinberg in a statement they are unsourced unverified and completely ridiculous the pga tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims
1718 ill be looked at as just some crazy f nobody making accusations about tiger olsen acknowledged to espn
1718 its been hammered over and over by golf analysts that tigers struggles in recent years have had more to do with his head than physical ailments that being said well need much more than talk radio allegations to put tiger into the same liarfraudcheater category as lance armstrong time will tell if this story has legs

1722 stories are coming out of managua nicaragua that a large bang was heard by residents there saturday evening and it registered on seismic detectors as well a crater was found in the woods measuring something like <number> meters <number> feet across claims are being made that this was a meteorite impact a space rock a meter or so across slamming into the ground at high speed
1722 phil plait writes slates bad astronomy blog and is an astronomer public speaker science evangelizer and author of death from the skies
1722 but im unconvinced reports are still a bit sketchy but my biggest doubts come in two parts
1722 <number> in a city of over two million people youd expect a fireball around midnight wouldve been seen by a lot of people i havent heard any confirmed reports of witnesses also i havent seen any video from it either the situation in chelyabinsk in <number> was different of course but video of that event showed up with an hour or two id expect that after two days wed have some visual evidence from managua by now
1722 note ive already seen a video on youtube claiming to be from the fireball but its not its a bright meteor that came in over spain dont be fooled by hoaxes there are always lots of them when something like this happens the picture at the top of this post appears in a lot of hoaxes it was from a fireball over the netherlands in <number>
1722 b no meteorite has yet been found if this was an impact there should be debris in the crater at the very least on a microscopic scale i havent heard of any analysis of the soil there to look for fragments either
1722 i am not saying this was not a meteorite impact i am saying the evidence for this that ive seen so far leaves me pretty unconvinced ill note this happened near an air force base too which again makes me a little more suspicious
1722 so my skeptic sense is tingling here and wont be assuaged until we get much better evidence than has been reported so far ill add that some places are reporting that this may have been connected with asteroid <number> rc which passed by the earth on sunday although this was a near miss <number> rc got less than <number> km from earth i am very very doubtful of a connection the asteroid passed at <number> utc sunday which was noon nicaragua time <number> hours or so after whatever happened in managua its incredibly unlikely that a small piece of that asteroid was that far ahead of the main mass and still managed to hit us the asteroid was moving at <number> kilometers per hour so it was still farther away than the moon when this event occurred
1722 bottom line this may or may not have been an impact from a meteorite at the moment based on what ive seen so far id bet against it but ive been wrong before until i see confirmed video or actual confirmed meteorite fragments ill remain doubtful
1724 london the islamic state militant known as jihadi john who has been seen in videos of hostages being beheaded has been named as mohammed emwazi by the bbc and the washington post
1724 the bbc said emwazi believed to be a kuwaiti-born british man from west london was known to british security services who chose not to disclose his name for operational reasons
1724 jihadi john has appeared in videos showing the killings of us journalists james foley and steven sotloff us medic abdul-rahman kassig and britons david haines and alan henning

1726 weve all had jobs we absolutely cant stand and thanks to the internet weve seen many examples of people quitting their jobs in amazing ways a video popped up on youtube today that appears to add yet another thread to this growing trend as a secret ending to a not-at-all-popular smartphone game called electric boogie the video shows a message from the games lead developer to his boss and the language isnt exactly kind
1726 working for you is a living hell the message reads you have your head so far up your ass its no wonder why your breath always smells like shit consider this cartoon animation and this letter my resignation from your pathetic company i quit adding ps your game fucking sucks
1726 the note is signed dbg <number> which would seem to credit it to a gameplay programmer named david gordon though mr gordons name still appears on the website of developer tripleplay apps if he did indeed quit in august david gordon is quite the trooper for remaining with the team a full four months later or they 're incredibly bad at updating the site
1726 then theres the matter of the games marketing which thus far has consisted of poorly conceived attempts at creating some viral buzz all of which have fallen completely flat for example an imgur gallery of horrible electric boogie parody movie posters had been submitted to several different subreddits before most of the links were eventually deleted
1726 the official youtube account of tripleplay apps doesnt seem to take the game itself too seriously either intentionally slamming it as terrible and the worst game ever this stands in stark contrast to the electric boogie page on the tripleplay apps website where they praise the game why would the developers of the game trash it on youtube its all very strange and seems to suggest a desperation to create buzz even in a so-bad-its-good way though none of it ever caught on
1726 tripleplay apps itself is a bit of a mystery as well as the companyif we can even call it thathas absolutely zero history of ios apps of any kind and very few on google play in fact electric boogie was published under the name qbical llc which is also based out of denton tex the same city where tripleplay apps is supposedly located
1726 a google search of any of the names associated with the company from the ceo to the disgruntled david gordon returns absolutely nothing not a single twitter account facebook page orand this is the best parta single credible image on any website including those associated with either of these companies
1726 in fact im not even sure if tripleplay apps qbical llc or whatever you want to call the person or persons who published electric boogie even has an office at all qbical llc is listed as a home business in a couple of smaller online business directories with a single address tripleplay apps uses this image on its website next to our company

1728 it 's a fake account the spokesperson said
1728 the account userzz surfaced over the weekend in response to a hashtag that made fun of a recent segment on fox news the segment involved author steve emerson who writes books on terrorism claiming that there are certain no-go zones for non-muslims in europe including birmingham which he wrongly claimed is a totally muslim city

1732 the new york police department which has been arresting tens of thousands of people a year for low-level marijuana possession is poised to stop making such arrests and to issue tickets instead according to law enforcement officials
1732 people found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting
1732 the change would remake the way the police in new york city handle the most common drug offenses and would represent mayor bill de blasios most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the departments excessive stop-and-frisk practices
1732 curbing arrests for small-scale marijuana possession has become a cause for criminal justice reform advocates and this year the new brooklyn district attorney kenneth p thompson said he would stop prosecuting such cases but his announcement did not go over well with mr de blasio and his police commissioner william j bratton who vowed to continue making low-level marijuana arrests

1732 the administration of bill de blasio is publicly embracing the notion that small-scale drug possession merits different treatment than arrests credit chang w leethe new york times now the de blasio administration is publicly embracing the notion that such small-scale possession merits different treatment and with the changes city hall is moving to retake control of a politically potent issue that has enormous resonance in the black and latino communities where a vast majority of small-scale marijuana arrests have taken place
1732 in the first eight months of the year blacks and hispanics represented <number> percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city according to a study written in part by harry g levine a sociology professor at queens college who is a director of the marijuana arrest research project
1732 many details of the changes planned by the de blasio administration are still being discussed at city hall and many questions remain unanswered under the new policy for example will the <number> grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis other key questions such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons may not be up to city hall
1732 a clearer picture is expected to emerge this week as mr de blasio prepares for his first meeting with the citys five district attorneys a spokeswoman for the mayor marti adams declined to comment on the proposed policy change although officials in two of the district attorneys offices confirmed that the de blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases
1733 an airport worker has become an unwitting star on the internet after he stripped down naked in front of heavy-handed security guards

1738 twitter users have been posting about the tearouts under the hashtags beardgate seamgate and hairgate
1738 last month after apple reported record sales of the iphone <number> and <number> plus users took to social media to discuss bendgate the term used to describe the claims that iphones may bend or become warped when carried in trouser pockets
1738 apple responded to reports by saying it only received nine complaints about bending phones and has tested <number> of them
1738 separately a fake advertisement claiming apple ios<number> users could wirelessly charge their iphones by placing it in the microwave went viral after users who fell for the scam ruined their devices
1739 if youve seen a story floating around on your facebook feed about banksy getting arrested and exposed dont worry because banksy is still anonymous and well the hoax was the work of a satirical news site called the national report which im not linking because fck those guys that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true usually without a trace of actual satire as filthy filthy clickbait its an awful yet unfortunately effective business model
1739 in a story which was published early this morning the national report claimed that banksy was arrested in london by a <number>-hour anti-graffiti task force and revealed to be a <number>-year-old man named paul horner the international business times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax
1739 paul horner is the name given to a facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users <number> a month another hoax story that comes around every now and again as well as the name from a hoax story about a <number>-year-old louisiana teen who was sentenced to <number> years to life after he called a swat team to another teenagers house after he beat him while playing battlefield <number>
1739 the article is also said to have been written by dr darius rubics a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who unsurprisingly since his previous stories include obama declares november national muslim appreciation month and dennis rodman leaves us to talk with leaders of isis has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism
1739 haha get it its funny because its not true i guess theres some logic in there somewhere its not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the the national report since theyre designed to trick unlike when dumb people share stories from the onion which are designed to actually be satire again and i can not stress this enough fck those guys
1740 us drones are being flown over raqqa in search of isis leader al-baghdadi
1742 barack and michelle obama are in riyadh today to meet with saudi arabia 's new ruler king salman bin abdul-aziz al saud footage of the king receiving the us delegation aired on saudi tv but several western commentators noticed something strange about the footage that made it to youtube there 's a big ol  ovoid blur where michelle obama should be
1742 msnbc 's chris hayes was one of the first to spread the story that saudi tv had blurred michelle out of the picture borrowing the coinage blurka to describe the apparent censorship of the first lady 's exposed hair he had to take it back shortly afterward though because as ben dreyfuss at mother jones and several saudi tv viewers on twitter pointed out the story was complete bullshit
1742 as much as people like wacky british conservative and former member of parliament louise mensch no fan of saudi arabia loved the hashtagzz story it was based on the false assumption that the tv station had added the blur
1742 saudi pigs enslavers of women blur the face of userzz as userzz fawns on them urlzz
1742 louise mensch userzz january <number> <number> actually footage of michelle obama aired uncensored in saudi arabia
1742 the blur was added after the fact by the person who uploaded it to youtube previous videos posted on that account were censored in the same fashion
1742 rip blurghazi <number>-<number> here is chris hayes with a short but poignant remembrance

1743 the duped mum ate her son  after being told it was cooked meat and rice but she is not the only one to have unwittingly eaten human flesh
1743 sick isis militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her son  after telling her it was cooked meat and rice
1743 the worried mum had bravely visited the terror group 's headquarters in a bid to speak to her loved one who had been captured and taken prisoner by islamic state militants in mosul iraq
1743 isis fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way
1743 however after giving the mother cooked meat rice and soup she was horrified to be told she had just eaten her son
1743 there have been a number of real-life hannibal lecters who murder their victims in order to eat their flesh
1743 but there have also been people who have eaten human meat by accident such as david scheiding who unwittingly ate some of a fast food employee 's finger which had found its way into his chicken burger
1743 more sinister are those who have been forced to eat their own flesh or another 's as part of a sadistic attack
1743 from an irish gang who made their victim eat his own ear to a mum who forced her sons to eat their own flesh

1746 aaron sorkin 's upcoming film about former apple ceo steve jobs has reportedly found its steve wozniak seth rogen
1746 the news first reported by variety on thursday comes just one week after sorkin confirmed that christian bale will portray jobs in the sony pictures film which is based on walter isaacson 's biography of the late tech luminary
1746 sony did not immediately respond to mashable 's request for comment about the casting report but rogen is no stranger to working with sony he previously starred in the studio 's this is the end last year and will star in the interview in december
1746 this is the seventh film sorkin has written including the social network in <number> it will be told in three sequences focusing on apple 's launches of the ipod next and the macintosh
1746 the movie like open roads  jobs flick starring ashton kutcher as as the titular character and josh gad as wozniak did will explore jobs  life particularly his relationships
1746 its not a biopic its not the story of steve jobs its something much different than that sorkin said in april hes a fascinating guy part hero part antihero hes a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life
1746 steve jobs passed away on oct <number> <number> sorkin confirmed this year that he finished the film 's script
1746 it will be up to the audience whether its good or not sorkin said but steve jobs is one of the very few times i ended up writing what i set out to write its an incredibly satisfying feeling
1746 wozniak was critical of gad 's portrayal personalities are very wrong although mine is closer so it will be fascinating to see what he has to say about rogen

1750 in designing its first wearable device in the apple watch apple looked to incorporate a variety of highly advanced health functions with an eye on creating a holistic monitoring device but ultimately scrapped those plans due to technological and regulatory hurdles
1750 according to the wall street journal sources claim apple watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in april specifically apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool one capable of measuring a user 's blood pressure heart rate stress level and more said people familiar with the matter
1750 the publication says the setbacks forced apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer as it stands apple watch boasts a variety of sensors including accelerometers touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor the latter of which connects to the ios health app for fitness and wellness tracking while polished and presented in a slick package apple watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of android
1750 aside from catchall smartwatch devices a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products usually wrist-worn from smaller manufacturers and startups for example the wme band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user 's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels while the latest products from fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring
1750 apple started development of its watch four years ago with an eye on health and fitness but the project was quickly dubbed a black hole for sucking in resources advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet apple 's rigorous standards sources said
1750 for example skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs but later testing showed actual results varied person to person with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings the company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features but results were inconsistent
1750 apple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs as evidenced by recently discovered job postings but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation watch instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory ios compatible smartwatch iphone companion and daily communicator among others
1750 apple watch does however sport a few apple-only features including apple pay integration and watchkit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year
1751 in case you hadnt heard a little movie called batman v superman dawn of justice is currently filming in and around detroit mi since we live in the golden age of social media networking set pictures and videos have fueled all kinds of speculation on whats going on in this movie from ben afflecks shoulder injury to jesse eisenbergs hair to scoot mcnairys legs the most recent set leaks revolved around batmans ride instagram users posted several pictures of the new updated batmobile which was promptly followed by an official photo released by director zack snyder the exciting design appears to be something of a hybrid between the tank-like vehicle used in christopher nolans bat-films and more traditional hot rod-inspired batmobiles of old
1751 meanwhile outlets like bleeding cool reported a rumor that one of the batmobiles from the movies set had been stolen the rumor was picked up by some of the mainstream media such as the local detroit cbs affiliate before being debunked by the detroit free press
1751 in response director zack snyder took to twitter as he does to send up not only the stolen-batmobile rumor but to reference a competing franchise snyder tweeted the following picture is snyder taking a sly friendly dig at jj abrams and the currently-filming star wars episode vii it would seem so but what if snyder had used say a joker or two-face lookalike or at least one of their henchmen the internet wouldve imploded this way snyder provides fans with a harmless bit of franchise-crossover in the form of this officially-sanctioned bit of fan-fiction the attention to detail is pretty funny too the way the gotham pd cop nearest the batmobile is looking at the stormtroopers blaster is priceless
1751 make no mistake zack snyder is following the online fan chatter hes not above calling in to a detroit radio show to defend aquamans badassery and apparently will comment on your instagram video when the mood takes him
1751 cbm caught snyders now-deleted comment  watching you  on the following video taken by ig user userzz who was home one night while the batmobile did burnouts on the neighboring batman v superman set snyder whose instagram handle is userzz has removed his comment but judging by the reaction of the videos other commenters the fact that snyder has weighed in at all delights them to no end
1751 the fact that the director takes the time to interact with his fans is genuinely heartening for audience members who may have questioned the decision to hand snyder not just an all-new superman and batman but warner bros and dcs own interconnected movie universe
1751 the leaked bvs set pictures and videos still dont answer any of the bigger questions about the films plot and whether or not it will be able to seamlessly integrate multiple superheroes while giving us a satisfying first-time team-up of the worlds finest but that wont stop us from poring over every image from detroit that we can get our hands on
1751 batman v superman dawn of justice will open in theaters on march <number> <number>

1771 according to supply chain rumors a samsung processor will power the apple watch
1771 the apple watch  which is expected to land later this year  is apple 's newest class of device and will integrate closely with the iphone and allegedly be powered by a samsung chip manufactured using the company 's <number>-nanometer process
1771 samsung used to manufacture chips for the iphone or ipad but it was replaced by tsmc apple allegedly switched suppliers because tsmc could produce processors using the smaller <number>-namometer manufacturing process the smaller the manufacturing process the smaller the chips and the less energy they consume
1771 the rumor is that apple has ordered <number> to <number> <number>-inch wafers monthly each wafer can supply several hundred processors
1771 one question that remains is why apple would choose a samsung chip built using a <number>-nanometer process over a smaller more efficient <number>-nanometer chip from tsmc perhaps it comes down to price or it could be that tsmc is already stretched supplying chips for iphones and ipads or maybe the report is inaccurate
1771 how many apple watch units that apple expects to shift over the course of the year is unknown although some analysts have suggested that the figure could be around the <number> million mark

1774 gill rosenberg <number>said last week on facebook that she was no longer updating her page because she was headed to an area without internet
1774 uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of israeli-canadian gill rosenberg who was apparently captured by isis
1774 islamist websites some of them known to be close or even serving as a front for isis reported sunday that the <number>-year-old was captured by their warriors during fierce battles with kurdish fighters in unspecified areas
1774 according to the websites rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves the websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture nor did they provide any proof of it
1774 the isis claims do not make clear whether rosenberg was captured in iraq or in syria the main lines of battle between kurds and isis are in the syrian-turkish border town of kobani but kurdish sources approached by israel radio reporter eran cicorel expressed doubt over the isis report they said rosenberg was not in kobani in the assessment of these kurdish sources the reports of rosenberg 's capture are probably isis propaganda
1774 the shin bet israel 's general security service told the jerusalem post that there are no further details at this stage
1774 rosenberg wrote on her facebook page on november <number> that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without internet access for at least two weeks until december <number> she wrote it is not clear where she went at this time
1774 if the websites  reports are true rosenberg would likely be the first western female to fall into isis captivity holding israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further
1774 unlike the united states and the united kingdom which refused to negotiate with isis over their captured nationals thus giving the impression of laissez faire interest israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists

1776 the engineers in the laboratory at quantico will be trying to determine if there was a dubbing did we have an original recording of this guy having a conversation no one wants to talk about and then the shots then dubbed over it was it the complete tape all accounts from browns side and the officers side say there was a single shot fired initially at the door of the police car so that shot followed by brown trying to flee and then the officer exiting the car and pursuing him and then firing the series of shots so were missing that first shot now i dont know cnn got this tape first did they censor it because the guy said something obscene over the first shot and they didnt want to air that we just dont know all that
1776 new day cohost michaela pereira defended the airing of the tape it needs to be said the lawyer who is representing the man who gave us the audio gave it to us she swears it is real pereira said we have no reason here at cnn to believe that its not true

1777 an article saying mcdonalds is removing the big mac apple pies and large size options isnt real
1777 it was published on daily buzz live a fake news website
1777 according to a disclaimer most are inspired by real news events and just a few stories are works of complete fiction those few articles are for entertainment purposes only the articles and stories may or may not use real names always a semi real andor mostly or substantially fictitious ways therefore just a few articles contained on this website daily buzz live are works of fiction any truth or actual facts contained in those stories or posts are purely incidental or coincidental and not intended to be or be construed as facts
1777 so while some of the articles are real news this article about mcdonalds is fake
1777 tens of thousands of people on facebook shared the bogus article as of sunday
1777 heres what the bogus article reads
1777 mcdonalds has just announced that it will be phasing out <number> menu items the beginning of next year and most mcdonalds customers are not happy
1777 with mcdonalds profits tanking over the recent months the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb spokeswoman lisa mccomb said in a statement to do so we must simplify our current menu
1777 this means the end of the big mac apple pie and large size menu items currently the big mac has a whopping <number> calories and <number>g of fat the apple pie contains <number> cal and it would take a full <number> minute to walk that off with that being said those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination
1778 the new york post decided that it was a good idea to report that members of isis may have been infected with ebola in other news andy borowitz has been hired at the new york post haha no kidding can you imagine though
1778 apparently the world health organization is investigating claims made by iraqi newspaper al-sabah that ebola and hiv-aids are spreading among residents of mosul brought there by terrorists and expats from different countries especially africa mosul is held by isis al-sabah is the official iraqi government newspaper
1778 mashable reports that the story which originated in al-sabah has spread amongst other pro-government and kurdish newspapers like a virus might such outlets have an interest in encouraging the notion that isis fighters were stricken with highly-stigmatized diseases hmm
1778 meanwhile forbes reported in october that isis maybe possibly could use ebola as a weapon
1778 so maybe that ridiculous scenario is coming to pass maybe maybe there 's just no way for us to know for sure then again we ve seen no specific credible intelligence that isis is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our homeland homeland security secretary jeh johnson said in october
1778 oh and also according to iraq 's ministry of health there are no doctors in mosul that have the capacity to diagnose ebola the reports are incorrect and unfounded a ministry spokesman said

1788 before apple unveiled the apple watch last september reports indicated the device would come with <number> sensors to track health and fitness data leading some healthcare professionals to find the unveiled apple watch 's health features disappointing in a new report the wall street journal offers a look at the original apple watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems
1788 apple began developing the watch about four years ago with a focus on health and fitness its not unusual for apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development but the watch was especially challenging people familiar with the matter said internally the project became known as a black hole sucking in resources one of these people saidthe apple watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram also known as an ekg apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user 's blood however a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product
1788 the skin conductivity features did n't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin while results varied depending on how tight an apple watch was worn on users  wrists additionally if apple decided to use the health data to provide health or behavioral advice the cupertino company would have to seek approval from the us food and drug administration and other regulators
1788 while these features were dropped for the first version of the apple watch sources tell the wsj that they could appear in future versions of the device echoing a reuters report from september
1788 last week apple ceo tim cook said the company 's objective with apple watch is to change the way people live their lives and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do which includes activity monitoring reminding users to stand up after a certain time period and non-verbal communication with friends apple is currently asking developers to have their apple watch apps ready by mid-february with some developers traveling to apple 's cupertino headquarters for help
1788 cook has confirmed the apple watch will launch in april the wall street journal reports that apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter with half of those units being the entry apple watch sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel apple watch

1803 mufid al-hasaynah minister of housing and public works in the palestinian unity government told xinhua that israel deliberately increases the suffering of the gazans
1803 dozens of houses were filled with water of the israeli dams which were largely opened this morning towards the gaza strip these actions double the people 's suffering who live under a tight israeli siege said the minister
1803 early on sunday rescue teams and firefighters rushed to the central area of the gaza strip to rescue dozens of palestinians who were stuck in their houses after israel opened the dams
1803 witnesses said that bulldozers were bringing sands to reduce the amounts of water that covered the houses in the area and that several main roads and streets were closed due to the floods

1804 seven girls from a bosnian school all aged between <number> and <number> have fallen pregnant during a five-day school trip to the country 's capital sarajevo
1804 the school is based in the bosnian town of banja luka and took <number> teenage girls on an educational visit to the city with intentions to visit museums and places of historical significance
1804 but it seems the unsupervised girls got up to a lot more than that while they were staying away from home the case has triggered serious discussion about the state of bosnia 's sex education with the number of <number>-<number>-year-old girls having underage sex having seen a dramatic spike in recent times
1804 a sarajevo-based gynaecologist senad mehmedbasic commented on how concerning the increase in underage pregnancies is that is the trend of today he said but we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school
1804 and continuing his point that education is the key to reducing the number of girls having underage sex he said
1804 it is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities not knowing the consequences we have to be more direct in the educational system it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters and that they are later slapped by life the parents of the girls are now understandably furious that such lack of care was taken to keep an eye on their children 's activities but the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici believes the blame should n't lie with the teachers on the trip but the parental neglect that caused the lack of reproductive understanding in the young girls
1804 we 're sure there is some truth in what he says  that it is the duty of parents as well as schools to inform their children of the dangers of unprotected sex both at such a young age and throughout their adult lives but for <number> out of <number> pupils  that 's a staggering <number> of girls who attended the trip  to have become pregnant is surely primarily down to the neglect of teachers who should have made it their duty to keep an eye on the girls for the duration

1807 reports that islamic state militants in mosul have contracted ebola swirled though iraqi media sources on wednesday world health organization officials said they have n't confirmed the cases but the organization has reached out to offer assistance
1807 three outlets reported that ebola showed up at a hospital in mosul a city <number> miles north of baghdad that 's been under isis control since june <number> the reports however have perpetuated mostly in pro-government and kurdish media
1807 we have no official notification from the iraqi government that it is ebola christy feig who 's director of communications told mashable
1807 feig added that who is in the process of reaching out to government officials in iraq to see if they need help investigating the cases a task that could be a challenge given the restrictions that would come with operating in isis-controlled territory
1807 it 's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in mosul are even able to test for the ebola virus a kurdish official who was convinced the cases are ebola told the kurdish media outlet xendan that the militants  symptoms were similar to those of the ebola virus
1807 however ebola symptoms nausea and vomiting diarrhea bleeding and bruising are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases including malaria lassa fever yellow fever viruses and the marburg virus also most confirmed ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in west africa
1807 citing an unnamed source in a mosul hospital iraq 's official pro-government newspaper al sabaah said the disease arrived in mosul from terrorists who came from several countries and africa
1807 while isis has recruited foreign fighters very few of them if any at all are believed to have traveled from west africa

1808 we 're just two months away from the apple watch launch and things still seem not to be set in stone some new features or misfeatures about apple 's first wearable foray are still coming in for this round the source is supposedly none other than ceo tim cook himself speaking to a crowd of apple employees at a flagship store in berlin cook was said to have given some good news for worried would be apple watch owners the smartwatch is resistant enough to use in the shower
1808 to be exact what the executive supposedly said was that he uses it everywhere even in the shower we presume that it is a subtle confirmation that the apple watch will be more rugged that first thought this would perhaps allay the worries of some over the device 's water resistant only properties especially in a time where other smartwatches read android wear are boasting ip<number> ratings
1808 the one place that tim cook does n't take his apple watch to is apparently his bed and it 's not for the lack of would be activity or sleep tracking apps the ceo admits that he does charge it every night that 's not surprising considering apple itself said that the apple watch would have enough battery to last you a day that however might exclude the wearable from night activities like sleep tracking it might also not satisfy those who are wary of smartwatches exactly because they have to charge it every night
1808 will the apple watch face tougher times especially with the longer lasting cross-platform and now colorful pebble time or even the rugged but classy lg watch urbane hardly if we take sales of any apple device as an indication however there is no denying the fact that apple is treading new ground and it has to take care to tread carefully if the apple watch is to go beyond a one hit wonder

1814 the quality fake news source the onion quoted fake people on a very real if unbelievable subject on march <number> <number> as the utah senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week a dea agent testified that he came across rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back-country its hard to believe a drug enforcement agents encounter with stoned rabbits but that parts real the fake part the onion quoted fake peoples reactions to the all-too-real news rabbits are going to be getting high anyway one hilariously fake person said better that it be safe legal and regulated
1814 the crappy fake news site the daily currant wrote a story under the headline marijuana overdoses kill <number> in colorado on first day of legalization on jan <number> <number> it began ridiculously colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses how anyone could believe such a story from such an outlet is still dumbfounding
1814 and now some more fake news is on the loose and it falls on the crappy lowest-common-denominator side the racket report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece kfc gets occupational business license to sell marijuana in colorado restaurants
1814 nevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment what about the scrolling news ticker above the headline pitching other news including exclusive photos of miley cyrus and justin biebers wedding and <number> people die after drinking bad coors lite at a funeral neither of those headlines threw off the <number>-plus people sharing this story to their own social media
1814 the racket reports piece said kfc decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their colorado franchise restaurants franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional <number> setup fee the kfc corporation was approved on february <number> <number> for their marijuana retail recreational pot medical marijuana occupational business license currently <number> of the nearly <number> kfc franchises in the state of colorado have added this option to their menu

1814 wrong as i wrote a year ago as the marijuana overdoses kill <number> story was going viral

1843 in quite recent news j j abrams has reportedly said at the visual effects society awards <number> that he may release his extremely anticipated film star wars episode vii the force awakens instead of winter he may move his film down the line for a summer release this is an extremely brave move if true as it puts star wars up against films like avengers <number> age of ultron ant-man and the long awaited jurassic world but who would win at the summer box office if it were to happen in my opinion star wars has got the strongest chance at the box office if moved to a summer release but why would he do it all the big films come out in the summer and i mean there 's no hobbit to compete with in december so why move it down to summer
1843 box office championship box office championship j j 's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the star wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching for example just one photo can give away a lot for instance if you do n't want spoilers look away
1843 sorry j j sorry j j for instance these <number> figures reveal the character 's kylo ren rey fin bb-<number> and shows us what kylo ren ol  crossguard will look like with his outer cloak removed i do see that if more of these pictures are leaked we could be seeing what han leia luke c<number>po etc will be like in the film before seeing a company made trailer which would ruin the surprise disney being the owners of the new star wars franchise have taken j j 's thoughts into consideration and deep thought which could get the film released a lot earlier than we thought we were going to see it there are some bad things about this though if we do get what we all wish for and we get to see star wars <number> about <number> months before we thought we were going to wo n't disney be in a panic if they thought that their blockbuster was coming in december would they have ordered toy designs trailers etc for later on in the year perhaps this is just paranoia but disney and j j will have a lot of work to get done if they want their merchandise etc to come alongside star wars in summer

1857 all party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named kim jong-un and train them to voluntarily change their names it reportedly reads
1857 those caught with the name kim jong-un it continued would have their identity cards school diplomas and official documents briskly adjusted

1858 you may have seen the amazing story today about the high school kid who made <number> million trading stocks there were plenty of red flags in the original new york magazine article but now cnbc is reporting that the <number> million figure is totally bogus
1858 mohammed islam a <number>-year-old high school kid in new york was profiled as a wall street whiz kid who was raking in millions the new york magazine piece implies that his wealth <number> million or not largely came from trading
1858 mo got into trading oil and gold and his bank account grew though he is shy about the <number> million number he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures more than enough to rent an apartment in manhattanthough his parents wo n't let him live in it until he turns <number>and acquire a bmw which he ca n't drive because he does n't yet have a license but the investment club that islam belongs to sent a statement to business insider
1858 it has been brought to the attention of the leaders investment club that mohammed islam has been rumored to have made <number> through making trades in the stock market after performing due diligence and talking with mohammed islam himself we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism the journalist who wrote the piece defends it saying that she saw a bank statement that confirms he 's worth eight figures
1858 so what 's the real story we can only speculate at this point but if history is any guide for wall street prodigy stories most of his wealth could come from an inheritance just last month yahoo finance had to issue a correction about the story of a <number>-year-old self-made millionaire it turned out that probably <number> percent of that man 's wealth came from an inheritance
1858 you can watch video of cnbc discussing the story of mohammed islam the high school millionaire below
1858 all this does n't mean that islam is n't still making decent coin from his trading nor that he 's not incredibly wealthy he 's just not worth <number> million and almost certainly did n't make the majority of his money trading stocks
1858 we 'll have to wait until the dust settles for the real story on this one but that could take a while islam cancelled an appearance on cnbc after getting spooked by producers in his pre-interview

1880 fear not arachnophobes the story of bunbury 's spiderman might not be all it seemed perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man 's body during his first trip to bali the story went global on thursday generating hundreds of stories online earlier this month dylan thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing a really burning sensation like a searing feeling in his abdomen dylan thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin dylan thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin mr thomas said a specialist dermatologist later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a tropical spider advertisement but it seems we may have all been caught in a web of misinformation arachnologist dr volker framenau said whatever the creature was it was almost impossible for the culprit to have been a spider if you look at a spider the fangs the mouth parts they have they are not able to burrow they ca n't get through skin he said we thought it may have been something like a mite there are a few different parasitic mites out there which can sometimes look a bit like a spider i ca n't think of any spider which could do this to a person dr mark harvey from the western australian museum agreed and said he found the case bizarre i must confess i was amazed because i ve never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human or indeed any mammal he said spiders need air to breathe they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs being under the skin of somebody i would have thought they would n't have enough air to survive even if it was a mite i ve never seen anything like this even if it was an insect i ve never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this so it really is a remarkable case dr harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends we hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin then the baby spiders burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics he said none of those are true they 're just made up stories they 're not actually able to dig through the skin that 's why this case is so unusual some can burrow into soil but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that something which is true according to dr harvey is that certain arachnids do live on humans we all have mites living on our faces they 're follicle mites but they 're absolutely miniscule and you ca n't see them we transmit them to our children when we have kids he said they live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin those mites are so small you ca n't see them and they 're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach dr framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender dead or alive and enlisting the help of experts it would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it he said if you have been bitten by something the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral dylan thomas has been contacted for comment

1911 in the days leading up to apple 's big event next week which is rumored to be focused on the apple watch a new detail about the company 's first wearable has been leaked along with all other features mentioned during tim cook 's unveiling of the smartwatch in september the device will also come with a feature called power reserve according to the new york times
1911 the report which cites an anonymous apple employee claims that the unannounced feature will allow the watch operate in a mode that only shows the current time on its display presumably to preserve battery power for other functions
1911 a standby mode for a wearable is n't particularly innovative but given the questions surrounding the battery life of the apple watch about a day according to apple a power reserve feature dedicated to preserving battery life could be the device 's saving grace particularly when figures like <number> are being tossed around the rumor mill as the price for the top tier model
1911 another surprising detail revealed in the report is that during field testing of the apple watch engineers disguised the device with a fake casing to make it look like a samsung smartwatch so if you ve seen apple employees walking around with what looks like a samsung gear and wondered why you now have an answer to the mystery

1917 apple originally planned for the apple watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this april the wall street journal reports
1917 the apple watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin you sweat more if you 're nervous and that makes your skin more conductive
1917 the watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user 's heart rate that 's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse but apple could n't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted it found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors and the watch did n't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist
1917 other features that did n't make it into the final apple watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking according to the journal those would have been tricky for apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the fda food and drug administration in the us we do know however that apple secretly met with the fda in <number> to find out which features would come under the agency 's regulation
1917 apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the apple watch because it simply could n't get them to work that does n't mean that it is n't going to add them back in future versions of the device though
1917 elsewhere in its article the journal says the apple watch was known at apple by the name black hole because it kept drawing in more and more resources development of the device reportedly took over four years

1949 news of the accidental airdrop which the associated press corroborated and the syrian observatory for human rights confirmed brought fresh criticism to a military tactic the air drop officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades but is still evidently prone to screw-ups and those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the islamic state in iraq and syria underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets

1949 another general sheepishly added yes thats what had happened
1949 the embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as gps-guided parachutes theres no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons and who is going to use them or how they are going to use them greg myre of the middle east institute told the daily sabah that is one of the risks you have to take
1949 it was a risk bill clinton was willing to take in <number> that was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern bosnia despite the military consistently arguing against involving us troops in airdrops in hostile zones given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable the associated press then reported the brass turned out to be right
1949 one major problem laid bare during that mission military scientists later said was what they called wind drift the problem was identified in the late <number>s john mcginley a scientist who researched the topic told the washington posts holly watt in <number> the terrain in bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy wind drift was causing all the problems

1965 the proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering but its also updated the famous adage that theres a sucker born every minute for the internet age and no circus attracts the suckers quite like the arab-israeli conflict not only will people believe anything about israel their editors will let them write it and as we learned yesterday pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the flood libel
1965 there are moments when biased coverage of israel goes beyond mere opinion last year the good folks at vox a notoriously error-ridden site declared the existence of a bridge connecting the west bank and gaza it was not a maddening mistake it was rather kind of endearing it was adorable in its own way but that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact
1965 same goes for new york times jerusalem bureau chief jodi rudorens claim in <number> that prospective jewish construction in the west bank would bisect the west bank and make physical contiguity impossible as was subsequently pointed out and corrected accordingly this was not even close to being true and rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map
1965 and this week we were treated to another version of this story though its one we hear often enough its a bit of a hazing ritual the palestinians find someone they havent yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold the lie is this that flooding in gaza was caused by israel opening dams in the south easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams they are the gaza-west bank bridge of this story and yet the story just keeps appearing because the palestinians never run out of western suckers
1965 one of the suckers this year was vice news to try to hide its ignorance vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the palestinians followed by this attempt at balance israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to vice news on monday
1965 other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel as honestreporting notes the daily mail went with a bit of false balance but also crucially added a straight correction and admission of error an earlier version of this article stated that israel had opened river dams in the south of the country causing flooding in the gaza strip in fact there are no dams in southern israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues we are happy to clarify this
1965 according to honestreporting the daily mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence the flooding was today compounded after an israeli power company cut electricity to two of gazas major west bank cities
1965 and according to camera both agence france presse and al jazeera shocking i know passed along the flood libel afp pulled its video and al jazeera went the vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute
1965 the flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others mistakes see this post from jonathan tobin in december <number> for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising idf spokeswoman libby weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbors ox

1967 palestinian officials say hundreds of gazans were forced to evacuate after israel opened the gates of several dams on the border with the gaza strip and flooded at least <number> households israel has denied the claim as entirely false
1967 in the wake of a recent severe winter storm in the region israeli authorities opened the floodgates to discharge the accumulated water palestinian officials say residents of eastern gaza reported injuries as well as deaths of livestock and poultry caused by the israeli action which allegedly came without prior notification gaza 's civil defense directorate cdd said sunday
1967 photos of the gaza strip flood have appeared in social networks but the date when they were taken ca n't be independently verified as yet
1967 the israeli army opened the floodgates of a canal leading to central gaza which resulted in the removal of sand mounds along the border with israel the cdd announced according to palestinian news agency wafa
1967 opening the levees to the canal has led to the flooding of several palestinian homes and we had to quickly evacuate the afflicted citizens
1967 no casualties were reported as a result but more than <number> families had to flee after their homes filled with water levels sometimes reaching more than three meters the gaza ministry of interior said in a statement
1967 in a letter to rt regarding the issue israels coordinator of government activities in the territories cogat maintained thatthe claim is entirely false
1967 southern israel does not have any dams due to the recent rain streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the state of israel cogat said
1967 the flood reportedly forced the closure of the main road connecting al-mughraqa district and nusseirat refugee camp south of gaza city leaving hundreds of palestinians trapped in the floods a difficult prospect for approximately <number> palestinians left homeless by israels assault last summer

2039 while laptop sales continue to drop apple 's macbook air has managed to remain popular and perform well this year apple is set to launch a <number>-inch macbook air which could just be apple 's biggest product in <number>
2039 after being rumored for quite some time the new laptop from apple has just been confirmed by the latest report from mark gurman of <number>to<number>mac apple has made a number of changes in the macbook air removing and redesigning what users know and love about the machine
2039 apple is preparing an all-new macbook air for <number> with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized usb ports magsafe connectors and sd card slots said gurman
2039 the new <number>-inch macbook air is said to be smaller than its <number>-inch sibling and a bit thinner than the <number>-inch version it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller than the latter which allows it to keep a slightly bigger display the bezels around the display have also been reduced giving the front part of the machine a brand new look
2039 much of the larger proportion of the machine 's usable area will be occupied by the display panel and the keyboard apple has noticeably deviated from the standard keyboard of the macbook air by cramming the keys in order to decrease the spaces in between
2039 other key changes include the transferring of the power button from the upper left-hand corner to the left side of the escape key and the removal of the travel on the track pad as a way to keep the laptop 's slim build
2039 the new macbook air is also a minimalist when it comes to ports as it will only be sporting two namely the headphone jack and a usb type-c port this means that fans of the machine will have to do away with the thunderbolt connection and the magsafe charger
2039 however the specs of the new usb indicate that the type-c can support driving displays and device charging
2039 the new usb type-c connector is smaller faster and more capable than the standard usb <number> and <number> ports on existing computers added gurman
2042 there 's a story currently making the rounds about an australian man who upon returning from a trip to bali discovered that a spider burrowed under his skin and traveled up to his chest freaky yes but it 's also not plausible
2042 rest easy arachnophobes you do not have to worry about charlotte weaving her web beneath your flesh the supposed story goes like this dylan thomas a <number>-year-old man not the dead poet was on vacation in bali and woke up one morning to discover a red trail of irritation running from his navel to his chest a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day
2042 thomas says that after initially being sent home with antihistamines he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin supposedly they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar according to thomas his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days
2042 it 's the kind of story that has a lot of people saying nope and a lot of arachnologists saying simply no that did n't happen thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did
2042 i think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible christopher buddle associate professor at mcgill university 's department of natural resource sciences told us in an email simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar  the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue  defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence  the spider itself is not presented
2042 dr charles e griswold schlinger curator of arachnology emeritus at the california academy of sciences said he could n't comment on this particular incident but was similarly skeptical in general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that he wrote
2042 could it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from thomas  body maybe but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen buddle told us other arthropods eg ticksmitesperhaps some insects could possibly  be associated  with something like this perhaps but certainly not a spider
2042 marie herberstein head of the department of biological sciences at macquarie university in new south wales does n't fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider though she writes i have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature there are no parasites amongst spiders but she also suspects it may be a different animal she told us my initial reaction is that this is a mite also <number>-legged rather than a spider and mites are renowned for this type of behaviour such as in scabies let 's see what the identification brings

2054 after a disastrous ios <number> rollout and a ton of publicity surrounding bendgate saying that apple had a bad week is an understatement
2054 unfortunately for apple things are n't looking much better this week as macrumors reports on a particularly nasty ios <number> bug which could potentially erase the iwork documents stored in your icloud drive
2054 according to the report the option to reset all settings found under settings general reset in ios <number> also deletes documents from the icloud drive permanently
2054 the option which normally resets settings to factory defaults clearly states that no data or media will be deleted however after some users on macrumors  forum complained about the bug macrumors tested the option out and indeed all the iwork documents stored in icloud drive both on the iphone and on icloudcom were gone
2054 even worse after icloud synced with a mac running os x yosemite the documents were deleted from the mac as well some of the documents including preview and textedit files were untouched but all iwork files seem to be affected
2054 in some scenarios it 's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder or via time machine but nothing is certain at this point and apple still has n't publicly acknowledged the bug for now ios <number> users who have icloud drive enabled should probably avoid using the reset all settings option
2054 have something to add to this story share it in the comments

2058 innovative might not be the first word that comes to mind when describing us telephone and cable company comcast but are we giving the company credit where credit is due
2058 lets face it after a harrowing <number>-minute customer service call went viral in july it looked like comcast had nothing more to strive for it had reached peak horrible yet if reports this week are accurate comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness it got a customers employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service
2058 the full story in all its sadistic glory is at consumerist but heres the sparknotes version a customer named conal started subscribing to comcast service in early <number> there were issues erroneous charges bills that never arrived discounts that werent applied conal considered cancelling his service but decided to stick with it after a comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks as another friendly gesture the company also allegedly sent and billed conal for <number> of equipment hed never ordered
2058 this is where it gets crazy conal understandably frustrated decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the comcast controller during the call he claims he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into comcasts billing and accounting issues shortly after that call comcast contacted conals employer a large accounting firm that consumerist reports happened to do business with comcast the rep claimed that conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call according to the story the firm opened an investigation against conal and then fired him from his job
2058 its hard to know whos telling the truth here conal tells consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked comcast for its part has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter thats a little strange if conal did invoke his companys name in a threatening way comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call so much for monitoring for quality assurance purposes if you want it done right record the call yourself

2060 the two biggest news stories of <number> collided wednesday when iraqi media outlets reported that members of the islamic state group  also known as isis  had contracted the deadly virus ebola but later updates from the world health organization and iraq 's ministry of health indicate the stories may be just rumors
2060 we have no official notification that it is ebola christy feig director of communications for who told mashable though who has contacted iraqi officials to offer help
2060 iraq 's ministry of health also denied that anyone in mosul had contracted the ebola virus which broke out in march in west africa spokesman ahmed rudaini told news site al-maalomah that mosul does n't even have the technological capability to diagnose ebola cases  only baghdad does therefore he said the reports that ebola has infected anyone in mosul are incorrect and unfounded
2060 the discussion started with an article in iraq 's official newspaper al-sabah that said terrorists brought ebola to mosul many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of mosul it read two ebola and <number> hivaids cases were registered
2060 ebola is primarily a threat in west africa where its latest outbreak has killed nearly <number> people mashable reported isis has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease its african members are primarily from algeria egypt morocco sudan and tunisia
2060 in the event isis does have ebola the militants could use it as a biological terror technique forbes reported in october members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others the individual exposed to the ebola virus would be the carrier national security professor al shimkus told forbes in the context of terrorist activity it doesnt take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier
2060 isis a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the united states and european union among others has controlled mosul since june iraq 's second-largest city is also isis  largest stronghold the group began spreading across the middle east last summer taking over large swaths of iraq and syria through brutal tactics

2067 the stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly yazidi iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for kurdish and iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital mosul dam away from isis aides to obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a us reprisal
2067 buffeted between calls to destroy isis and criticism of their shifting rationale obama and the pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep they point out the consistency of the goals obama has articulated since <number> august preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting us personnel in iraq
2067 yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of iraqi kurdistan and the destruction of isis vehicles artillery and fixed positions from mount sinjar to the mosul dam the murder of foley delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the us for his death and isiss threat to kill another american journalist steven sotloff is also testing obamas goal of safeguarding us nationals in a country overrun by isis

2072 anna wintour reportedly has a major rat infestation at her vogue office in new york city
2072 according to radar online some of the dirtiest rats have decided to move into annas new office for herself and vogue staffers at the freedom tower
2072 insiders claim that rodents invaded the beloved accessories closet leaving an abundance of rat droppings all over their pricey couture computers and desks further reports claim that the decision to put kanye west and kim kardashian on the cover of vogue magazine may have something to do with the infestation
2072 the office is over-run and the vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for annas decision to put kim kardashian and kanye west on the cover there was so much backlash and now this
2072 as previously reported by the inquisitr critics were not very happy with anna wintour and the vogue staff making the disgusting decision to place the reality starlet and her husband on the cover the couple was photographed for the april <number> cover by anne leibovitz
2072 vogue and cond nast relocated from times square to one world trade center however the rat infestation has not made the vogue relocation as smooth as they would have liked especially since reports claim that the rats are only located on the vogue floors of the building
2072 there were droppings all over the floor and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into the rats appear to have gotten in via the venting which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changesand its assumed this is how the rats got in
2072 even though anna wintour usually allows employees to eat and drink inside of the office reports claim that a strict policy restricting food and drinks has been issued and enforced until the infestation problem is resolved
2072 gawker the media outlet that initially broke the story reports that anna wintour refuses to even enter her office until it is in pristine condition and completely freed of its rat infestation
2075 it 's what national security organizations have feared since day one-the world health organization who announced last week that they are evaluating jihadist militants associated with isis who may have contracted the virus responsible for ebola while the who has yet to confirm whether or not the fighters are exhibiting symptoms the current evaluations of a mosul hospital <number> miles north of baghdad are prompting concerns that the fringe extremist group isis may in fact be able to obtain a biological weapon unlike anything the world has seen before
2075 like us on facebook
2075 though mosul has been under isis control since late last june the iraqi health ministry has issued a press release denying reports from iraqi news outlets that claim the soldier are definitively infected and seeking treatment in mosul
2075 the ebola virus could be in any area in the world including mosul where they do n't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus spokesperson for the health ministry ahmed rudaini says they are incapable to detect it
2075 over the past several months the world has watched as threats from extremist group isis have come true from the beheadings of captured prisoners of war to the mass murder of children 's schools and with the possibility of a global pandemic looming over our heads many are demanding action be taken to isolate the potential vectors as a worst case scenario yet as conflicting reports abound international health organizations and the who are unable to assess the health concern on site and treat the patients as their own
2075 who director christy feig told reporters early this weekend that we the who have no official notification from the iraqi government that it is ebola
2075 while that may be true the possibility that the militants may have contracted the virus causes a problematic situation for the who in that isis does not believe in modern medicine and an outbreak in an isis-controlled area like mosul could be a breeding ground for the ever-mutating virus but worst of all aside from the possibility of possible infection of iraq should isis isolate the virus for themselves the entire western world may find soon enough that the ebola virus could be the worst weapon known to man
2075 un workers have thus far been prohibited from entering isis-controlled territory in both iraq and syria intelligence analyst for levantine group benjamin t decker says in this context the lack of medical infrastructure supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both isis fighters and residents of mosul

2077 from distributor circles in the apple environment is heard that the californian technology giant apparently not planning to send apple watch also to the resellers at least in the initial phase will be the smartwatch reserved exclusively for retail stores to monopolize the market and to create additional admissions in the apple stores

2077 since it would certainly fit into the picture when the reseller will not be initially supplied with tons of devices

2091 the department of homeland security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of al qaeda now going by the name bhakkar fatwa is planning multiple attacks against american consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on november <number>th the day known as black friday
2091 bhakkar fatwa is a small relatively unknown group of islamic militants and fanatics that originated in bhakkar pakistan as the central leadership of al qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of us military operations in afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world the group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the middle east africa and europe within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the cia and the department of homeland security as they have begun actively recruiting on american soil
2091 jeh johnson director of the department of homeland security has referred to bhakkar fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in america their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country always quietly and out of sight and previously without any violent operations officials at both the cia and homeland security think that may be about to change
2091 jack phillips agent in charge of monitoring bhakkar fatwas american operation detailed the agencies recent findings working with both the cia and the nsa we were able to access conversations and communications between members of bhakkar fatwas domestic organization and their leadership in pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against american citizens at retail operations on the <number>th of november said phillips the instructions sent from pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day the leadership of bhakkar fatwa views the american religion as one worshiping money and possessions they commanded these attacks as being against the holiest temples that the americans serve
2091 we have taken several actions based off of this information stated phillips we have detained three individuals who were in active communication with pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks all three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned the names of those detained will not be immediately released they have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat
2091 if you are going out shopping early on friday please keep your eyes open phillips advised at this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be we are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations but this terrorist group is savvy they utilize a small closed cell structure and we may not be able to identify all of them in time i urge all americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk and if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability i am sure we will resolve this issue but i still recommend taking adequate precautions

2098 this surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the spanish man of <number> who died at the hospital in madrid in early january the health of the young man quickly deteriorated after suffering an allergic reaction unexplained and all drugs used to contain anaphylaxis have been totally ineffective the team of experts claims to have been able to determine that genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death

2098 at first we thought there had been some form of contamination of food contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained dr rafael prez-santamarina it  is that when we tested the tomato itself we noticed that it contained certain allergens commonly found in seafood we did a lot of different analyzes and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of allergens that killed mr ramos

2116 the site set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on manhattans busy <number>th street would mark an experiment by amazon to connect with customers in the physical world amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping until now though it couldnt compete with the immediacy of a traditional store
2116 amazons space at <number> west <number>th st across from the empire state building in midtown would function as a mini-warehouse with limited inventory for same-day delivery within new york product returns and exchanges and pickups of online orders
2116 opening a physical location is about marketing the amazon brand said matt nemer a wells fargo analyst same-day delivery ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on amazon needs to be at the center of that
2116 amazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory particularly its devices like the kindle e-readers fire smartphone or fire tv set-top box according to people familiar with the companys thinking
2116 operating stores also carries risks until now amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing including leases paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores those expenses could imperil the companys already thin profit margins
2116 some details about the new york store could n't be learned immediately including the size length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there people familiar with the matter cautioned that amazons plans could change and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful
2116 if it is successful however the new york location could presage a rollout to other us cities according to the people familiar with the companys thinking
2116 amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years even scouting locations in its hometown seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea said another person familiar with the effort amazon once sold kindles in wal-mart stores inc and target corp outlets but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to amazons growing power in retailing

2125 bih seven primary school students pregnant after five-day excursion
2125 bih presumably refers to according to the article the ministry run by serbias national coordinator for reproductive health nenad babici babici is the only source the article uses for the story
2125 the original article has now been linked by the new york post the london daily mail the new york daily news australias courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and several others none have performed any follow-up to confirm the original reporting one newspaper though added details to the story that were never reported
2125 but were getting ahead of ourselves lets start with the underlying original story
2125 even in bosnia such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and neer-do-wells jumping in front of a camera and copious b-roll of the schools front entrance none of this is present the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it happened but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school
2125 national coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of <number> or <number> and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a five-day trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it
2125 he said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of children
2125 babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature births

2127 we have ruled out any ebola case in kansas city kansas city health department director dr rex archer told reporters on monday he said the man who had recently traveled to nigeria did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels

2129 the united states appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the is stronghold of raqqa syria the pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the mq-<number> reaper
2129 the two photos show the distinct downward facing v-shaped tail used on predator drones and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles as such the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes rather than in a hunter-killer type mission
2129 according to local activists the drone has been circling over the city for three hours if the reports are true this would suggest that the air environment over raqqa is permissive drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems
2129 the evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery and possibly signals intelligence sigint of islamic state positions in the groups most important stronghold there is little doubt that this mission is intended to give us policymakers more information about is positions in raqqa however it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against is positions in syria
2129 as of now there is no information about where the drones are based however open-source information allows for some informed guesses
2129 the united states currently bases predator drones in turkey at incirlik air force base in turkey the three drones are routinely flown over northern iraq and data is shared in real time with the turkish military
2129 a second possibility could be that the drones are being flown from kuwait satellite imagery captured the deployment of us drones at ali salem air base
2129 a third option is that the united states is now flying drones from an airbase in iraqi kurdistan
2129 a regional security expert also reports that predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near erbil

2132 the video was a fake at least according to a witness who says he was there while the youtube hit how does a homeless man spend <number> was filmed

2132 the video was picked up by dozens of media outlets including the inquisitr and in the week the clip has been on youtube has racked up more than <number> million views
2132 why because thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs but on food and not just for himself he used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in orange county california
2132 while determining how much revenue any particular youtube video creates is difficult by many estimates a video can earn between <number> and <number> for each million views it accumulates
2132 that means paler lin may have grossed anywhere from <number> to <number> off this single video in one week
2132 perhaps more important paler lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video to raise more money for thomas that campaign has so far brought in about <number> in donations from people moved by the selfless acts thomas performs in the video
2132 but in an interview posted on the site vocativ on tuesday taugan tan kadalim who says he stumbled by chance across paler lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing calls the entire scenario bull

2163 elected officials and activists in new york are reacting positively to the city 's new policy that loosens how it treats people found in possession of marijuana
2163 many had earlier said that young minority males often were the subject of arrests for marijuana possession and asserted that punishment for what they considered a relatively minor crime could often affect a person 's entire future
2163 in light of the fact that there have been a disproportionate amount of blacks and browns subjected to low level marijuana arrests as well as the fact that many cities around the country are legalizing marijuana use it is timely for the city of new york to revise its policies said the rev al sharpton a new york city-based activist in a statement
2163 with excessive gun violence hard drug trafficking and other criminal ills that have plagued our community i feel that the police ought to concentrate on things of importance rather than things that are now being legalized in many places around the country he said

2163 this new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young new yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations de blasio said today 's action is the latest in a series of steps commissioner bratton and i have taken to rebuild the relationship between the nypd and the communities they serve we are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests
2163 voices of dissent with the current policy were underscored by brooklyn district attorney ken thompson who said in july that he would not prosecute low-level marijuana possession cases because of the concerns about how such arrests can affect the lives of young minority men

2176 longtime nbc nightly news anchor tom brokaw reportedly wants his successor brian williams thrown out of the big chair after he admitted fabricating key portions of a story he repeatedly told about his reporting experience during the iraq war in <number>
2176 the new york post citing sources at the network reported that brokaw <number> has been making a lot of noise at nbc that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report
2176 brokaw was the anchor of nbc 's flagship evening newscast when williams filed his initial report in march <number> in it williams described how he was traveling in a group of helicopters forced down in the iraq desert on the ground williams said he learned the chinook in front of him had almost been blown out of the sky he showed a photo of the aircraft with a gash from a rocket-propelled grenade
2176 williams succeeded brokaw as the nightly news anchor following the <number> presidential election and his story evolved over time
2176 in a <number> blog post williams said that his helicopter had come under fire from what appeared to be iraqi farmers with rocket-propelled grenade he said a helicopter in front of his had been hit
2176 then in a <number> appearance on david letterman 's late show on cbs williams said that two of the four helicopters he was traveling with had been hit by ground fire including the one i was in
2176 on wednesday williams recanted that story claiming he was that he was flying in a chinook helicopter behind the formation that took fire however on thursday the military newspaper stars and stripes which broke the story reported that williams was actually flying with a different helicopter company altogether in a different direction and linked to the attacked unit only by radio
2176 adding to the intrigue the post reported that brokaw and former nbc news president steve capus who left the network in <number> knew that williams  updated version of his tale was not true before the anchor 's admission wednesday evening the paper also says nbc news executives had counseled williams to stop telling the story
2176 despite brokaw 's campaign the paper says nbc will take no action against williams believing that his on-air apology wednesday will suffice
2177 on monday morning a report surfaced claiming that comcast has been discouraging customers from using the tor browser a browsing program designed to allow users to surf the internet with greater anonymity than most browsers mondays report was repackaged on a number of other sites stating that comcast has declared war on the tor browser the report goes on to suggest that comcast has contacted some users telling them that they risk disconnection if they continue using tor the report may have generated a lot of clicks but is totally inaccurate
2177 comcast is not asking customers to stop using tor or any other browser for that matter we have no policy against tor or any other browser or software customers are free to use their xfinity internet service to visit any website use any app and so forth
2177 here are the facts
2177 comcast doesnt monitor our customers browser software web surfing or online history
2177 the anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate
2177 we respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer 's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process just like other isps more information about these policies can be found in our transparency report here
2177 we do not terminate customers for violating the copyright alert system aka six strikes which is a non-punitive educational and voluntary copyright program read more here
2177 our customers can use tor at any time as i have myself im sure many of them are using it right now
2178 comcast has lately found itself issuing public apologies on a somewhat regular basis as subscribers share tales of horrible customer service
2178 but the latest accusation leveled against comcastthat it is threatening to disconnect customers who use the anonymity-providing tor browserhas n't been backed by convincing evidence that it 's happening and comcast dismisses the rumor as wildly inaccurate
2178 it began saturday with a site called deepdotweb claiming that comcast has declared war on tor browser
2178 reports have surfaced via rdarknetmarkets and another one submitted to us that comcast agents have contacted customers using tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service the article said a comcast agent named jeremy allegedly called tor an illegal service the comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies the comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the tor browser the customer refused to answer the next day the customer called comcast and spoke to another agent named kelly who reiterated that comcast does not want its customers using tor
2178 kelly allegedly told the customer that users who try to use anonymity or cover themselves up on the internet are usually doing things that arent so-to-speak legal we have the right to terminate fine or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules
2178 i think the story is nonsense
2178 there was good reason to be skeptical of this report a search of the subreddit rdarknetmarkets for comcast and tor turned up nothing update here is the reddit post quoted by deepdotweb any organized comcast campaign against users of tor would likely inspire numerous customer complaints not just a few as noted by cato institute research fellow julian sanchez and security researcher robert graham who wrote on twitter
2178 this story is wildly inaccurate comcast spokesperson charlie douglas told ars customers are free to use their xfinity internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise
2178 while comcast publishes an acceptable use policy the company doesnt monitor users browser software or web surfing and has no program addressing the tor browser douglas said

2186 a hoax that went viral on the internet has left fans of one country musician wondering exactly how all the madness began
2186 inquisitr reports that the internet was aflame with reactions after fake news that country legend willie nelson had died although <number>-years-old the legendary crooner has not yet kicked the bucket
2186 the rumor about nelson 's demise first began on the fake site msmbc according to inquisitr the initials for the site so closely mirror the actual news organization msnbc that people glancing at the headline understood it to be true
2186 the fact the story cited made up police officials also lent it an undeserved air of credibility the story claimed that nelson 's body was found on the front lawn of a property he owns in maui hi

2187 the most expensive apple watch set to go on sale in april will have to cost around <number> according to analysis done by the timepiece blog grail watch
2187 that 's mostly because the apple watch edition has a frame made from solid <number>-karat gold which is very expensive
2187 grail watch notes that gold sells for between <number> and <number> per ounce these days by that measure the apple watch edition 's frame would cost around <number> for the larger <number>mm version excluding all other costs
2187 that 's assuming the watch 's case is made from solid gold not gold-plated but the blog notes that apple 's marketing material never uses gold-plated or gold-filled which is conventional terminology for gold-plated materials and that apple must abide by laws governing how jewelry makers describe their products
2187 the conventional wisdom so far has been that the apple watch edition will cost <number> apple has only announced the price of the low-end apple watch sport which will sell for <number>
2187 but gold-framed luxury watches usually go for well above the <number> mark cartier 's tank mc lists for <number> and jager-lecoultre 's reverso squadra hometime lists for over <number>
2187 even if the apple watch edition sells for less than its analog competitors it will still be apple 's most expensive product
2187 grail watch predicts the larger apple watch edition will go for <number> with the smaller version retailing for <number>
2188 when apple introduced its apple watch in september the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from only the base model got an official price of <number> however now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions
2188 macrumors spotted a french blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel apple watch variant will start at <number> while gold models could cost <number> and up the igen blog has been credible in the past correctly predicting the size of the iphone <number> and <number> plus
2188 if you take the view that apple watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget the prices may not make that much sense look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts though and the anticipated costs sound viable apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist its already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand
2188 the stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me look at pebble to see why
2188 pebble steel fashion
2188 you can buy a plastic pebble smartwatch for as little as <number> now recently discounted from its <number> price the same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you <number> or double the plastic models price its reasonable to assume an apple watch with stainless steel casing will cost <number> based on that i wouldnt be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap with an additional <number> to <number> cost for a matching stainless steel strap
2188 unfortunately were not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring as apple wont be selling the apple watch until then for now potential customers have time to save up for apples timepiece something they may need to do if they want an apple watch in gold

2213 right now the apple watch 's battery life is about one day but paczkowski 's sources say apple is working on some modifications to make the watch last longer on a charge before its <number> launch
2213 this aligns with what we ve heard from apple as well since a company representative told us the watch can be charged at night apple has n't offered any further comment on the watch 's battery life
2213 battery life has been one of the biggest obstacles facing wearable devices that 's because a lot of smartwatches run on components that are meant for smartphones and are n't properly optimized for wrist-worn gadgets chris jones vice president and principal analyst with canalys insight told business insider in a previous interview
2213 we 're expecting so much from these early products in the market when we do n't really have dedicated components to go inside these devices jones said we 're nowhere near seeing the best of what can be developed out there

2217 in an aptly described joint policy initiative mayor de blasio and police commissioner bill bratton announced monday that most people caught with small amounts of marijuana in the city will get slapped with summonses instead of arrested
2217 the historic move marked a public about-face for bratton who earlier this year vowed nypd practices wouldnt change after the brooklyn district attorneys decision not to prosecute first-time offenders for low-level pot possession
2217 sources said the new policy was ordered by de blasio whose campaign promises included ending marijuana arrests that overwhelmingly targeted minorities
2217 it began with the mayor as his initiative said an elected official familiar with the issue it was something very dear to the mayor that had to happen no matter what
2217 bratton the sources noted did not resist de blasios directive
2217 the nypd declined to comment city hall credited both men with the idea
2217 this is a joint policy initiative developed and implemented by commissioner bratton and the leadership team at the nypd and fully supported by the mayor a de blasio spokesman said
2217 joined by de blasio at <number> police plaza bratton said he and other police officials had been working on the change in policing tactics for the last number of monthsunder the new policypeople busted for possessing <number> grams or less of pot a violation under new york law will no longer be cuffed hauled off to a police station fingerprinted and booked
2217 bratton held up a plastic sandwich bag stuffed almost full of oregano to illustrate how big a stash was at issue
2218 matt taibbi the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire pierre omidyar 's first look media is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside omidyar 's organization a source close to first look confirmed today
2218 taibbi 's abrupt disappearance from the company 's fifth avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication reportedly to be called racket which first look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn
2218 when he was hired amid much fanfare taibbi 's website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by first look an ambitious digital journalism company funded by omidyar the founder of ebay and one of the richest tech moguls in america like its counterpart the intercept launched earlier this year by glenn greenwald and others to pursue investigations of nsa surveillance and the intelligence world it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience prior to joining first look taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for rolling stone most famously he described goldman sachs as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the simultaneously funny and satirical voice associated with the legendary magazine spy over the succeeding months the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the new york digital scene including deputy editor alex pareene formerly of salon laura dawn a digital video producer who formerly worked with moveonorg and edith zimmerman founding editor of the hairpin
2218 journalists should be dark funny mean people taibbi told new york in an interview in march it 's appropriate for their antagonistic adversarial role
2218 omidyar originally conceived of first look as a network of interlinking sites run by independent journalists many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism over the last year however the center of gravity of the organization has shifted as omidyar and his silicon valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission over the summer omidyar appointed a longtime confidante john temple a former newspaper editor who previously led an omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in hawaii to be the president for audience and products putting him in a position above eric bates the former rolling stone editor who was brought on as a first look editorial director who is close to taibbi the confrontational approach that made taibbi 's name at rolling stone and before that as the founding editor of the gonzo moscow expatriate magazine the exile appears to have contributed to internal trouble at first look
2218 sources confirmed that taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of taibbi 's absence the launch date for racket which taibbi indicated in september would be coming in a month now appears to have been pushed off
2218 we have a target date but i wouldnt make a launch date public said temple who is based in san francisco when reached by phone this morning i dont comment about internal matters and i dont comment on personnel matters i mean were a private company so why would we no
2218 taibbi 's absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside first look which omidyar founded last year originally in response to the disclosures of nsa surveillance leaked by edward snowden to greenwald and his intercept colleague laura poitras omidyar initially committed <number> million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused digital magazines in july the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being choosing instead to focus on racket and the intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism the intercept has lately been publishing vigorously breaking several major stories federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government 's voluminous terrorist watch list but racket has been much slower to materialize leading to rumors of staff anxiety
2218 in august temple told me taibbi 's site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism for instance ellen miller head of the campaign finance watchdog the sunlight foundation a nonprofit also heavily financed by omidyar met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics
2219 a british man who went to fight with the kurds against islamic state has claimed the terror group fed a desperate mother a meal of meat and rice before revealing she had eaten her own son yasir abdulla <number> from yorkshire said that the woman had appealed to is to release her son when they tricked her
2219 adbulla told the sun the woman was offered a seat at is headquarters then given a drink along with cooked meat and rice at first she thought they were being generous but when she finished the meal they revealed the cooked meat was the flesh of her son whom they had murdered earlier
2219 mr adbulla said i hate is because of what happened to an old kurdish woman from a nearby tribe her son was captured by is fighters and taken as a prisoner to mosul
2219 she was determined to find her son and went to is headquarters and asked to see him the is men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son
2219 they brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat rice and soup she thought they were kind
2219 but they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said youve just eaten him
2219 he added all the tribes are united against is they burn people alive they chop off peoples heads there is no limit to their depravity they are not muslims they have hijacked islam all they do is hate
2219 this is not the first report of horrific barbarism by the islamic state a group that have become famous for the gruesome treatment of their prisoners in some cases they have beheaded them on camera and in others they have burnt them alive
2219 the woman who ate her son has not been traced
2220 an unverified audio recording that may have captured the shooting of michael brown is being investigated by the fbi according to a report news that a recording had surfaced was revealed on cnn although the network said it had not independently confirmed that the alleged gunshots heard on the tape were from the shooting of the unarmed <number>-year-old in ferguson missouri on aug <number> in the recording a man who has not been identified is heard speaking when a series of gunshots can be heard in the background there is a quick pause and then another round of gunshots are fired according to cnn the man lives near where brown was killed and was talking to a friend online at the time which is how the ambient sound was recorded the man didnt realize what he had recorded initially and only later became aware it could be tied to the brown case according to lopa blumenthal the lawyer representing the man who made the recording the tape could have huge relevance on how this case might finally end up

2221 fidel castro is dead
2221 sooner or later it will be true but on friday for the umpteenth time miami was distracted by the rumor that mr castro <number> who has survived revolution assassination attempts countless cigars substantial stress a fall after leaving a stage and a life-threatening stomach ailment had finally succumbed
2221 hope springs eternal said james cason the former head of the united states interests section in cuba from <number> to <number> and now the mayor of coral gables a wealthy enclave in miami-dade county he must have died <number> times since the time i went to cuba

2221 there is always doubt about this the joke is on us said manolo alvarez <number> a retired painter laughing as he held court with his friends in front of the cuban cafecito counter but eventually it will happen no one is immortal and he will join the devil

2221 in this case the story probably stemmed from a simple mix-up the death of a lesser-known namesake in a faraway country fidel castro odinga the son of a prominent kenyan politician raila odinga died on sunday and was eulogized on thursday a similar mistake occurred in august <number> when a cuban revolutionary figure rene orley sanchez castro died in cuba spawning a swirl of speculation around the world

2228 fortunately they are not armed with lasers they use cameras and sensors to monitor their assigned area and look for suspicious activity they are armed with high-definition cameras and audio recorders able to record events and voices analyze faces read license plates and even detect biological and chemical agents
2228 the k<number>s also use laser scanning and gps for navigation have weather sensors and communicate via wi-fi their batteries run for about <number> hours and the k<number> will return to a dockpower station to recharge
2228 should they spot a problem they call a human security guard i 'm just waiting for knightscope to decide to cut out the middle man or for bored microsofties to try and hack the thing to play pranks on people
2228 that sounds like the plot of a bad syfy movie does n't it
2230 by benjamin kang lim and tony munroe beijingseoul oct <number> reuters  north korean leader kim jong un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg a source with access to the secretive north 's leadership said on thursday playing down speculation over the <number>-year-old 's health and grip on power north korea 's state media which usually chronicles kim 's whereabouts in great detail has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on sept <number> the source said that kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises he ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too they were crawling and running and rolling around and he pulled a tendon the source told reuters on condition of anonymity he injured his ankle and knee around late august or early september while drilling because he is overweight he limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened the source said kim who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in <number> had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in july which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury kim needs about <number> days to recuperate said the source whose information could not be independently verified kim jong un is in total control said the source who has close ties to pyongyang and beijing friday is the <number>th anniversary of the founding of north korea 's workers  party an event kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred if kim does not turn up it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle experts said the longer he remains out of the public eye the more uncertainty about him and the status of his regime will grow said curtis melvin a researcher at the us-korea institute at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies in washington not kim 's first absence north korean officials have denied that kim 's public absence since early september is health-related and a us official following north korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble it remains unclear why a leg injury would keep kim out of the public eye for so long although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view in june <number> six months after coming to power state media failed to report on or photograph him for <number> days he re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium speculation that kim 's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a north korean tv report late last month that said he was suffering from discomfort some pyongyang watchers also suggest that kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the asian games in incheon south korea another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in pyongyang the source with knowledge of kim jong un 's health said rumors of a coup were rubbish it would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans said andray abrahamian of the choson exchange a singapore-based ngo running a program for north koreans in southeast asia north korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling kim family kim 's sister kim yo jong is known to have an official role within the ruling party his brother kim jong chol and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye kim was absent from a sept <number> meeting of the supreme people 's assembly or parliament the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago however kim 's name has not disappeared from state propaganda thursday 's edition of the workers  party newspaper the rodong sinmun carried three letters to kim from overseas allies on its front page and has reported on returning athletes from the asian games who thanked the marshal for his support during the competition abrahamian said it was unlikely kim had been usurped kim jong un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted it is unlikely that they would want to remove him given his unmatchable symbolic value again though everyone is guessing he said additional reporting by james pearson editing by mike collett-white and raju gopalakrishnan

2236 speculation is mounting that one of the senior taliban detainees swapped for a us army prisoner of war has returned to militancy following a leak to cnn
2236 no us official has yet confirmed the allegation on or off the record if true it stands to plunge the obama administration back into an acrimonious debate about its prisoner exchange for sergeant bowe bergdahl and its long-frustrated aim of closing guantnamo bay
2236 cnn reported on thursday that one of five taliban members formerly held by the us at guantnamo may have re-engaged in unspecified terrorist activity representative devin nunes the california republican who chairs the house intelligence committee said in a statement he can not confirm or deny the report

2237 it 's not exactly legalization but in new york city it could become the next best thing tickets for marijuana possession instead of arrests
2237 according to a report on sunday from the new york times the new york police department nypd is planning to announce new guidelines that would allow those found in possession of small amounts of marijuana to walk away with a ticket instead of spending time in handcuffs
2237 the change in policy could have wide-ranging effects in a city known for arresting thousands citizens each year for marijuana possession
2237 if true the change in policy could also have a significant impact on the city 's black and hispanic community which some studies say are disproportionately affected by the police department 's current marijuana arrest policy
2237 the upcoming shift in enforcement which the report says is something of a throwback to the city 's policy in the late <number>s comes just days after alaska oregon and washington dc voted to legalize cannabis joining colorado and washington events that may point toward a national trend

2238 many of todays modern customer service departments are notorious for leaving customers with anything but service phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customers time if a live customer service representative is actually reached they may cheerily declare a customers problem solved only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well and sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand
2238 but a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them ladies and gentlemen please welcome comcast
2238 while definitely not comcasts first trip to the bad customer service rodeo this latest case may trump all others with comcast getting a guy named conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with comcast reports the consumerist
2238 conal an employee with a prominent accounting firm received wrong products extra products he didnt request or need wrong bills and unwarranted bills in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by comcast that he could not get resolved through comcast customer service so he went above their heads to the comcast powers that be including their controller
2238 an unforeseen conflict that conal didnt recognize however is that his company did business with comcast one of the higher ups at comcast did see this though and headed back over to conals employer apparently intent on turning conals complaints to comcast against him
2238 this obviously influential comcast executive had discussions about conal with one of the partners in conals company and conal got the boot shortly thereafter
2238 conal says hed only ever received positive reviews for his work but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with comcast conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked this seemingly allowed comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get conal fired for daring to complain about their services
2238 in the end conals employer says they fired him based on an email from comcast that gave an overview of conals alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with comcast employees
2238 conal meanwhile says hes never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity and comcast wont release any documentation they have regarding his situation either

2249 the department of homeland security is denying a congressmans assertion that fighters with the militant group islamic state also known as isil or isis have been caught crossing the southwestern border
2249 the suggestion that individuals who have ties to isil have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground a dhs spokesman said in a statement today dhs continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border

2251 havana ap social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of fidel castro 's death but there was no sign friday that the reports were true even if the <number>-year-old former cuban leader has not been seen in public for months
2251 similar speculation has swept across cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in <number> handing over leadership to his younger brother raul
2251 the new wave was prompted in part by fidel castro 's failure to comment after the us and cuba declared on dec <number> that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago

2256 new footage of the elusive yeti captured amid the snowfields of russia is sparking renewed debate about the creatures existence as some see definitive proof while others claim the video is nothing more than a publicity stunt

2257 the book was not opened immediately due to its age and its contents were still unclear but bostonian society president brian lemay pronounced himself absolutely thrilled by the find which was not expected

2260 a humorous report on a satirical web site done in the style of china 's state broadcaster cctv offers advice to chinese on how to choose their english names english names come with different connotations its not always fair to those people but they do the article warns a name can come with a feeling or idea about what sort of person you are and where you come from
2260 the adoption of unconventional english names in china and other parts of east asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats any young anglophone who teaches english in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class
2260 one friend of worldviews who taught english and civics in the southern chinese city of guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen english names were derived from screen names used during online computer games there was orcapm who was not to be outdone by skycoolz
2260 sure have fun and pick a random object or word as a name but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in america the post chides it offers this guide
2260 a good way to work out the feeling of a name is to watch a bunch of american movies and sitcoms theyre full of name stereotypes youll find the good girls are all janes the jock boys are still buds and the geeks are called sheldon
2260 the report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of english names typically adopted by chinese be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common chinese family names such as wang or dong in general it 's good to avoid food as a name it suggests
2260 to put bluntly names like candy lolly sugar think anything sweet are typically thought of as non-smart girl names or stripper names
2260 its not always right there are doubtless some very smart candys out there but its the first thing that comes to mind
2260 other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities pick any name like obama einstein or madonna and youre going to get some stares it says you have some pretty big shoes to fill there

2264 strauch said those observations were very interesting and important adding nicaragua will invite experts from nasa and other countries such as uruguay to spend a month investigations at the site

2272 in a new video released late friday night abubakar shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released
2272 the issue of the girls is long forgotten because i have long ago married them off he said laughing in this war there is no going back

2275 when apple released the first iphone it only came with apple 's pre-loaded applications
2275 a year later apple opened the app store which allowed developers to make applications for the iphone
2275 the app store is probably the smartest thing apple did for the iphone it created a rich ecosystem of applications that made the phone an indispensable tool for hundreds of millions of people it also launched billions of dollars worth of new businesses think instagram uber snapchat etc
2275 with the apple set to release an apple watch a lot of people expect a similar thing is going to happen with third-party applications from developers
2275 developers we ve spoken with caution that people should temper expectations at least initially they say apple is limiting what apple watch apps are capable of doing early on in order to ensure a smooth launch and maintain battery life
2275 i think apple is taking a similar approach with the apple watch and iphone saying to themselves we do n't have an option to fail on this  sumit mehra cto of app studio y media labs told business insider so apple is limiting all this nice stuff all these sensors nfc haptics heartbeat sensor gyrometer everything apple is only going to allow developers to do the basic stuff to just get the apple watch out there because either it 's not ready or they do n't know what the implications of something like this could be
2275 mehra says he thinks it all boils down the apple 's continued efforts to increase the battery life of the apple watch accessing sensors drains the battery life so apple is preventing developers from using these sensors in their apps to avoid launching a device with a lineup full of battery-hogging apps
2275 sensors take up a lot of battery and they dont want every app out there on the apple watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life and then its not a watch anymore if i have to charge my wrist every four hours
2275 apple currently does n't allow developers to create standalone apps for the apple watch though apple has promised it will open up watchkit later this year for now apps offload all the heavy lifting and computations to the tethered iphone which saves battery and gives developers access to the iphone 's powerful processor

2321 royster stated the word freshman naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus she said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as freshman with that royster stated freshman may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students causing them to be targets
2321 the term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time royster said given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way
2321 royster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender
2321 using language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward she said moving away from language including pronouns that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions
2321 at this semesters student orientation leader training administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called first-years no public announcement was made regarding this change administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news

2330 journeyman golfer dan olsen retracted claims tiger woods had been suspended by the pga tour for using performance-enhancing drugs after both the pga tour and woods  agent mark steinberg vehemently denied the claims
2330 olsen told espncom 's michael collins it was only my opinon courtesy of espncom 's bob harig everything i said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any firsthand knowledge or facts olsen told espncom i want to make a full retraction to everything i said for the entire radio interview and i apologize to tiger nike phil mickelson commissioner tim finchem and the pga tour
2330 olsen certainly made several major allegations per harig olsen claimed on <number>am the game in lansing michigan that woods had been suspended for a month due to the use of peds and that an exempt player he did n't name had revealed the information he also claimed that woods used a cheater ball
2330 it 's not testosterone but it 's something else olsen told the station per harig i think when it 's all said and done he 's gon na surpass lance armstrong with infamy
2330 these claims are absolutely unequivocally and completely false  said steinberg in a statement earlier courtesy of harig they are unsourced unverified and completely ridiculous the pga tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims

2379 a representative of mr oberholtzers company mark-<number> plumbing company tells cbs news that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an autonation dealership in houston last year
2379 were members of the ansar al-deen front or their reps operating in texas buying used trucks or was there a more indirect path

2386 in a horrifying act of revenge for us airstrikes in northern iraq militants with the islamic state extremist group have beheaded american journalist james foley and are threatening to kill another hostage us officials say
2386 the white house must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the islamic state against resisting any action that could result in the death of another american
2386 it will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the islamic state in syria where president barack obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant american firepower
2386 obama was expected to make a statement wednesday about foley 's killing
2386 us officials confirmed a grisly video released tuesday showing islamic state militants beheading foley separately foley 's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a facebook page that was created to rally support for his release saying they have never been prouder of him
2386 he gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the syrian people said the statement which was attributed to foley 's mother diane foley she implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages like jim they are innocents they have no control over american government policy in iraq syria or anywhere in the world
2386 foley <number> from rochester new hampshire went missing in northern syria in november <number> while freelancing for agence france-presse and the boston-based media company globalpost the car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control he had not been heard from since
2386 the beheading marks the first time the islamic state has killed an american citizen since the syrian conflict broke out in march <number> upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war the killing is likely to complicate us involvement in iraq and the obama administration 's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both iraq and syria

2389 small-time drug offenders in new york city could soon find themselves on the receiving end of a ticket instead of inside a jail cell if a policy change on low-level marijuana possession is adopted this week the move would overwhelmingly affect black and latino residents who represented <number> percent of marijuana possession arrests in the city this year according to the marijuana arrest research project
2389 advocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on ones record but there is a chance that the policy which new york city mayor bill de blasio is expected to announce monday could boomerang the strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana likely to be defined as <number> grams or less to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed arrested and fingerprinted but doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review which would identify if a summons was justified in the first place legal experts say
2389 under the current system when an arrest is made the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor a prosecutor could throw out the charge or refuse to prosecute should he or she see any indication that the arresting officer violated due process such as searching a persons backpack without probable cause prosecutorial reviews perform a screening function to weed out legally insufficient cases jeffrey fagan professor of law at columbia law school in new york told international business times under the new policy that function has now been eclipsed he said
2389 that sentiment was echoed by brooklyn district attorney kenneth p thompson who announced earlier this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana violations the brooklyn das office has dismissed <number> misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of <number> such cases since july according to the new york times allowing police officers to write tickets without accountability creates a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place thompson told the times these cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred
2389 another possible repercussion of the citys proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket some <number> people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in <number> issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or can not miss work on the day of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system its not solving the problem that theyre trying to solve fagan said
2389 as many states counties and cities across the country have done at various times over the past several decades new york decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in <number> the law made possession of the drug a ticketable offense and applied to marijuana that was out of public view and was not being smoked nevertheless police have continued to arrest people and charge them with misdemeanors after finding small amounts of marijuana in their pockets or belongings at this point not arresting people for weed would n't be progressive it 'd be catching up with the mainstream gabriel sayegh the new york state director of the drug policy alliance told vice

2406 that 's the worrying prospect suggested by an unverified report from the london-based syrian observatory for human rights that isis has three warplanes in its possession in northern syria
2406 the syrian opposition group also claims citing reliable sources in syria that former iraqi military officers are training members of the sunni extremist militant group to fly them
2406 the planes are at the al-jarrah military airport east of the contested city of aleppo the syrian observatory for human rights said
2406 the former iraqi military officers are among those who have joined isis and people living near the airport have said that they recently saw an airplane flying at low altitude after it took off according to the observatory

2407 depending on your perspective this story could be read as an inspiring tale about the child of bengali immigrants beating the odds or as a worrisome example of how wolf of wall street-worship along with a taste for bottle service models and bmws is corrupting our youth
2407 if the story is actually true islam told new york that his net worth is in the high eight figures but its not clear where the <number> million figure came from and no documentation of his profits has yet appeared it would be interesting to know a little something about his trading strategy well update if and when we hear from him so far islam has not yet responded to our messages sent via facebook
2407 update islam has now told cnbcs scott wapner that he didnt actually make <number> million trading that he doesnt know where the figure came from that he in fact has made a few million dollars trading and that he is uncomfortable with the way he was portrayed in new york the attention is not what we expected he told wapner we never wanted the hype

2411 a mcdonald 's burger bought <number> years ago has an uncanny resemblance to its modern day counterpart twenty years ago opening statements in the oj simpson trial were being heard a company called aol rolled out internet service and two aussie blokes purchased a hamburger from a local mcd 's two of those three things changed dramatically one did n't and in another <number> years that burger offering will no doubt still be going strong in all its wrinkled uber-preserved glory
2411 according to <number>newscom out of australia friends casey dean and eduard nitz only <number> and <number> years old at the time bought some burgers at an adelaide mcdonald 's two decades ago they ate their burgers but a quarter pounder with cheese they bought for a friend went uneaten
2411 no worries  the friend asked the boys to hold onto the burger until the next time he was in the city either the friend never returned or the burger turned into a bit of an inside joke either way the teens turned into adults but the burger refused to age
2411 we 're pretty sure it 's the oldest burger in the world dean said it started off as a joke you know we told our friend we would hold his burger for him but he never showed up and before we knew it six months had passed
2411 those months turned into years and now <number> years later the burger looks the same as the day we bought it perfectly preserved it its original packaging dean said
2411 the pair were featured on australia 's channel <number> news threatening to finally take a nosh even though it was for charity the trustees of the burger just could n't bring themselves to bite into it can you blame them all of which begs the question exactly what is in a mcdonald 's burger that keeps it looking the same <number> year later

2413 you may have a seen a story going around facebook that promises you 'll be able to float in the air on january <number>th as a result of a planetary alignment that will decrease gravity for <number> minutes unfortunately it is total bullshit
2413 the story originates from dailybuzzlive a fake news site that admits it occasionally publishes works of complete fiction and it 's being widely shared because it includes a tweet from nasa that boosts its apparent credibility
2413 but nasa denies both the tweet and the bogus claim that a planetary alignment will somehow let you float for <number> seconds at a time
2413 these rumors are false and the image of a nasa tweet circulating is a doctored image the agency said in a statement to alcom microgravity exists only off earth the crews aboard the international space station live and work in microgravity where they conduct science experiments that take advantage of this unique environment aboard the orbiting laboratory temporary microgravity can be created using aircraft flying in parabolic arcs
2413 bad astronomer phil plait also took down the hoax in his slate column pointing out that he had to debunk the exact same rumor last year after it was passed around by a different fake news site not only that but it 's actually based on a hoax that 's been around for <number> years
2413 patrick moore cited in dailybuzzlive 's article was actually a notable british astronomer and he did actually make the zero g day claim in <number> what the piece leaves out is that it was an april fools  day joke
2413 for the record pluto and jupiter are n't aligning on january <number>th and it would n't matter if they did because they 're much much too far away to exert the kind of gravitational force the fake article describes
2413 here 's plait
2413 in fact doing the math i find that the earth pulls on you about <number> trillion times harder than pluto does that 's about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms

2423 because ios <number> was so sluggish on my ipad <number> i reset all settings no data or media will be deleted and sped it up but deleted my iwork data then promptly synced and deleted it in icloudi have public beta of yosemite so ca n't roll back via time machine i have no pre ios <number> backups in itunes or icloud to revert to well icloud device backups do n't contain cloud documents and i should have ios <number> backups in itunes but ca n't find any icloud has no trash like dropbox they seem gone foreverthe reset all settings option explicitly says that no data or media will be deleted and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings that the option is deleting icloud drive documents appears to be a serious bug though it may be limited to apple 's own iwork apps like pages keynote and numbers one user had all of his iwork documents wiped by using reset all settings while other app information remained in icloud
2423 in our own testing using reset all settings deleted all iwork documents stored in icloud drive on the iphone and on icloudcom after allowing time for syncing to a mac running os x yosemite all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well preview and textedit documents which can not be accessed on the iphone remained untouched on the mac
2423 there appears to be no simple way to recover icloud drive documents that have been erased by reset all settings in yosemite and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents a mavericks user was however able to recover his files from a backup folder and os x yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via time machine
2423 one user said that apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data
2423 introduced with ios <number> and os x yosemite icloud drive is apple 's answer to cloud-based storage services like dropbox icloud drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets pdfs images and more accessing them on any device currently os x mavericks users can access icloud drive documents via icloudcom but icloud drive will be fully functional in october after os x yosemite is released

2431 while mass manufacturing of the apple watch hasnt begun yet there are already concerns that sapphire production wont be able to meet initial demand the constraints will likely result in making more expensive apple watch models harder to come by
2431 all sapphire for the apple watch is coming from apples plant with gt advanced gtat in arizona because of apples very stringent quality specifications gtat will reportedly be unable to meet the level of output apple had hoped
2431 not all apple watch models use a sapphire display however the lowest-end apple watch sport uses strengthened ion-x glass while the mid-level apple watch and higher-end gold apple watch edition use sapphire
2431 initial supply constraints are not uncommon for apple products especially entirely new product categories like the watch if lines to see the watch in person during paris fashion week are any indication demand will be extremely high when it goes on sale

2434 two of the nations leading experts on the use of deadly force by the police are warning against overreaction to an audio recording that purportedly captures the sound of the gunshots that killed michael brown
2434 the newly surfaced recording which has not been publicly verified by investigators was first broadcast by cnn
2434 on the <number>-second clip it is possible to hear a series of what appears to be quick pops followed by a brief pause and then another succession of rapid shots st louis attorney lopa blumenthal and her client who wishes to remain anonymous to the public took the recording to the fbi on monday blumenthal says she counted <number> shots fired
2434 there 's that pause which is what gave me pause when i first saw it blumenthal told yahoo news it was a pause so there was time to think about it and deliberate that does n't mean that i 'm saying it helps one side or the other but i do know that in a <number>-second tape where eight seconds of it is a shooting a three-second delay is a significant period of time
2434 ron martinelli and michael levine both longtime criminal justice consultants told yahoo news that the audio needs to be authenticated and considered with other evidence before its importance can be evaluated
2434 pauses may or may not be anything of tremendous significance said martinelli a retired officer and criminologist specializing in police practices the answer is it depends in the end this is about a forensic reconciliation of statements and forensic facts and evidence
2434 levine a retired dea agent and law enforcement trainer said that anyone willing to put a value on a recording before it has been corroborated is discrediting themselves
2434 if they gave that opinion on a witness stand they would be chewed up and spit out by any defense attorney even a defense attorney that got his degree at sears roebuck school of law levine said
2434 blumenthal told yahoo news that she has no qualms about bringing the recording forward
2438 innovative might not be the first word that comes to mind in describing comcast but are we giving the company credit where credit is due let 's face it after that harrowing <number>-minute customer service call went viral in july it looked like comcast had nothing more to strive forit had reached peak horrible yet if reports this week are accurate comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness it got a customer 's employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service
2438 the full story in all its sadistic glory is at consumerist but here 's the sparknotes version a customer named conal started subscribing to comcast service in early <number> there were issues erroneous charges bills that never arrived discounts that were n't applied conal considered canceling his service but decided to stick with it after a comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks as another friendly gesture the company also allegedly sent and billed conal for <number> of equipment he 'd never ordered
2438 this is where it gets crazy conal understandably frustrated decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the comcast controller during the call he claims he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into comcast 's billing and accounting issues shortly after that call comcast contacted conal 's employera large accounting firm that consumerist reports happened to do business with comcast the rep claimed that conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call according to the story the firm opened an investigation against conal and then fired him from his job
2438 it 's hard to know who 's telling the truth here conal tells consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked comcast for its part has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter that 's a little strange if conal did invoke his company 's name in a threatening way comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call so much for monitoring for quality assurance purposes if you want it done right record the call yourself

2446 residents fear a mechanical six-foot-tall carol singing bear could be hit with an asbo after receiving complaints his festive tunes were causing a noise nuisance
2446 although the bear named bernard by staff at the loft caf in ampthill road shefford stands outside each day bringing joy to passing children who run past him trying to make him sing and dance it would seem he doesnt make everyone so merry
2446 on monday an enforcement officer from central bedfordshire council visited the caf to inform staff that there had been complaints made about bernards singing because he was causing a public nuisance

2446 employee abbie mcgee said the children love him and theres even one woman who used to put <number>p in his pocket every time she went past
2446 as soon as you shut the door you cant hear him anymore he isnt loud i cant believe there have been complaints is no-one allowed to have fun anymore it seems really silly that someone would moan about a bear when were on the high street where there is constant noise from the pubs and traffic
2446 he only sings christmas songs
2446 ellen a regular at the loft who has asked for her last name not to be used said bearing in mind that he is not singing  loudly and actually can not be heard in the cafe i and a great many others in town fail to understand the problem
2446 there are so many issues that do require council attention locally that i find it ludicrous that taxpayers  money is being used to effectively gag this popular toy  notwithstanding the fact that it is christmas time and with all the serious issues people have to deal with on a daily basis its actually great to see people smiling as they walk or drive past and see him singing and dancing away

2469 the united states appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the is stronghold of raqqa syria the pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the predator the two photos show the distinct downward facing v-shaped tail used on predator drones and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles as such the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes rather than in a hunter-killer type mission according to local activists the drone has been circling over the city for three hours if the reports are true this would suggest that the air environment over raqqa is permissive drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems the evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery and possibly signals intelligence sigint of islamic state positions in the groups most important stronghold there is little doubt that this mission is intended to give us policymakers more information about is positions in raqqa however it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against is positions in syria as of now there is no information about where the drones are based however open-source information allows for some informed guesses the united states currently bases predator drones in turkey at incirlik air force base the three drones are routinely flown over northern iraq and data is shared in real time with the turkish military a second option could be that the drones are being flown from kuwait satellite imagery captured the deployment of us drones at ali salem air base

2472 tim cook tim cook the watchs ability to survive in water isnt surprising since its designed as a workout accessory in addition to something people wear around town the device has to be at least somewhat resistant to human sweat and in protecting it against that kind of moisture it makes sense that apples engineers would make it showerproof as well

2472 it wont be long until consumers will be able to try out all of that for themselves cook revealed last month that the watch will be available for sale in april

2497 if <number>to<number>macs latest findings are true than apples biggest product of the year could be the macbook air you know right behind the apple watch according to early reports apple has completely redesigned the macbook air ditching the full-sized usb port magsafe connector and sd card slots for something entirely different
2497 <number>to<number>macs mark gurman writes the <number>-inch macbook air will be considerably smaller than the current <number>-inch version yet also slightly narrower than the <number>-inch model the new <number>-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the <number>-inch version yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display in order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current <number>-inch model the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides
2497 profilecompare copy <number>to<number>mac 's artist michael steeber designed renditions of what the new air could look like here 's a side view of the rumored <number>-inch air left compared to the current <number>-inch air right
2497 why this matters we already have an <number>-inch macbook air and a <number>-inch too so doesnt a <number>-inch just seem unnecessary to keep up the macbook airs reputation of being ultra-light and ultra-portable it makes sense to keep the airs screen size at <number>-inches or less however something smaller than <number>-inches will just be too small so the <number>-inch could actually fill that just right sweet spot nicely
2497 its not all about the size however if <number>to<number>macs design estimates are correct this is the start of a new design shift for the macbook air well see features that are slimmer and more compact than before with an edge-to-edge keyboard a modified trackpad and a thinner profile yes the air will actually be getting smaller
2497 apple could also introduce usb type-c on the new air which means it would no longer need a magsafe port as reports on usb type-c indicate that it can be used to power computers <number>to<number>mac believes this single port could be used as a sort of hub allowing users to plug in multiple devices to the air
2497 of course this is just speculation at this pointapple has yet to announce a new macbook air officiallybut <number>to<number>macs artist renditions are pretty cool check out their full report for more details

2521 the hoax story has been circulating far and wide on twitter and facebook
2521 it may feel like winter is slowly squeezing all the sunlight out of your day but if you see any news stories claiming the earth is headed for six days of total darkness then dont start stocking up on the tins of beans and torches just yet
2521 satirical news site huzlerscom has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week taking in numerous facebook and twitter users and encouraging them to post about what theyre going to be up to during the six days of darkness
2521 the story on the vaguely official looking website titled nasa confirms earth will experience <number> days of total darkness in december <number> claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame causing dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block <number> sunlight
2521 this is false although solar storms certainly are real phenomena they occur due to fluctuations in the suns magnetic field theyre not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt
2521 instead they create very minor disturbances in the earths magnetosphere historically there have been rare storms that could knock out electrical systems today but they 're mostly of the order of magnitude only likely to throw a homing pigeon slightly off course not blot out the sun
2521 however the hoax story even drafts in some credible-sounding sources including nasa chief charles bolden who reportedly warned the public to stay calm some users even linked to a real video of bolden talking about emergency preparedness an official-sounding phrase that apparently bypasses common sense to hit the big button marked panic in the brain
2521 in actuality bolden recorded the video to encourage us families to think about what they would do in the event of an earthquake or hurricane natural disasters that are a real enough threat in america
2521 this total-darkness hoax apparently comes in a couple of flavours some claim that a non-existent photon belt is responsible for the blackout and are so widespread that nasa employees even had to debunk the rumours themselves back in <number>

2524 today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of james foley by the terrorist group isil obama said using one of several acronyms for the group the militants who posted the video on youtube tuesday said foleys killing was in retaliation for us airstrikes in iraq

2525 the home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large dorito-speckled smirk on his face while plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on facebook and twitter the sleuths at gossip cop quickly proved that it was fake probably by looking at it
2525 the awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the msnbcwebsite url which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories a new phony report has the headline sources guns n roses frontman axl rose found dead in west hollywood home at age <number>
2525 enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than <number> times on social media like facebook again this is totally fake msnbcwebsite pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about macaulay culkin the phony culkin story is almost identical to the phony rose story dont believe any report coming from msnbcwebsite via gossip cop
