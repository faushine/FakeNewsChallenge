28 in designing its first wearable device in the apple watch apple looked to incorporate a variety of highly advanced health functions with an eye on creating a holistic monitoring device but ultimately scrapped those plans due to technological and regulatory hurdles
28 according to the wall street journal sources claim apple watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in april specifically apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool one capable of measuring a user 's blood pressure heart rate stress level and more said people familiar with the matter
28 the publication says the setbacks forced apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer as it stands apple watch boasts a variety of sensors including accelerometers touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor the latter of which connects to the ios health app for fitness and wellness tracking while polished and presented in a slick package apple watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of android
28 aside from catchall smartwatch devices a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products usually wrist-worn from smaller manufacturers and startups for example the wme band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user 's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels while the latest products from fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring
28 apple started development of its watch four years ago with an eye on health and fitness but the project was quickly dubbed a black hole for sucking in resources advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet apple 's rigorous standards sources said
28 for example skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs but later testing showed actual results varied person to person with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings the company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features but results were inconsistent
28 apple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs as evidenced by recently discovered job postings but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation watch instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory ios compatible smartwatch iphone companion and daily communicator among others
28 apple watch does however sport a few apple-only features including apple pay integration and watchkit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year

50 another rape allegation has surfaced against famed comedian and actor bill cosby this time it is from a familiar face which speculates that there may be some truth to cosby 's sketchy past
50 actress and singer raven-symone who rose to fame with cosby in the hit television sitcom the cosby show revealed to the tmz offices that she too had been raped and drugged years ago following the shows last episode
50 there are whispers that cosby would n't allow raven-symone in the production of the last season of his show but abruptly changed his mind it was never revealed what changed his original intentions
50 her lawyer gave an announcement to the press here is an excerpt
50 we among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable my client raven-symone is also ready to tell her side of the story a side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed there was no monetary compensation that made my client keep quiet but more so the respect for mr cosby well that respect has come to an end and what we thought was a mistake or anomaly has surfaced to become a lifestyle we will be pursuing damages that are not going to be disclosed at this time
50 on sunday cosbys attorney issued a statement saying the accusers are rehashing decade-old discredited allegations
50 lawyer john schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated does not make them true but this particular accusation is interesting we have a very successful star in raven-symone who does n't look to need any press or financial reward which makes us think that cosby has a really shady past

50 cosby has never been criminally charged with sexual assault but he did settle a civil case in <number> brought by temple university employee andrea constand who claimed he drugged and groped her at his suburban philadelphia mansion

57 after sending a tweet that many observers said they believed was directed at bill cosby a twitter account claiming to be that of the cosby show actress lisa bonet was suspended the account was suspended saturday following a nov <number> tweet directed to no one in particular that piqued the attention of many in the media including the new york post and fox news
57 according to the karma of past actions ones destiny unfolds even though everyone wants to be so lucky nothing stays in the dark <number>ever the tweet said
57 bonet starred as denise huxtable on cosby and many said they believed the tweet was directed at her former on-screen father who has of late suffered a devastating blow to his public persona public anger prompted numerous partners to sever relationships with the embattled actor and comedian as a result of allegations he raped more than a dozen women during his career that were reignited by comedian hannibal buress last month

57 cosby and bonet were rumored to have had a falling out during the <number>s because cosby did not approve of her decision to shoot a sexually explicit scene in the <number> r-rated film angel heart or to pose topless for a photoshoot with interview magazine bonet left the cosby show to shoot the spin-off a different world but returned after giving birth she parted ways with the show again in <number> and chose not to be part of a reunion special

58 when tim cook hits the stage monday to reveal availability and pricing information about apple watch the biggest question he will answer will be about the price of the high-end edition line rumors have pegged that price to range between <number> and <number> not a lot perhaps compared to a gold rolex but a <number>-year-old rolex will still tell the time who knows how functional the first apple aapl <number> watch will be in five years
58 there is now a new development in the pricing story a new apple patent has surfaced for a method and apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite in simple terms this new apple gold is lighter stronger and more scratch-resistant than ordinary <number> karat gold through alloys of low-density ceramic particles instead of precious metals it also contains roughly half the amount of pure <number> karat gold as ordinary <number> karat gold which is <number> gold <number> silver and <number> copper the math is all explained in geeky detail on a blog called all this
58 how much actual gold will be in the apple watch edition for the models on apples current edition page the answer is about half an ounce current value <number> what apple isnt showing on this page is a gold edition with a solid gold link bracelet this bracelet only appears in stainless steel on the apple watch collection page it is not an unreasonable assumption that apple will roll out a gold link bracelet edition which could add another full ounce of gold total current value <number>
58 apple-watch-edition-value-of-gold
58 still with john gruber of daring fireball estimating a price range of <number> for the edition the profit margins start looking a little rich marco arment is calling it at <number> but he is not talking about a solid gold bracelet in the fine jewelry business it is not uncommon for the retail price to be between five and ten times the cost of the raw materials see this analysis from apple spotlight on how much tiffany customers pay for form
58 apple reported in september that the profit margin for the entry level iphone <number> was <number> and slightly higher for the pricier models that iphone <number> costs apple <number> to make according to a teardown published in recode lets assume that the basic apple watch will cost apple no more than that considering that its retail prices is supposed to start at <number> that would have the total cost to apple for the apple watch edition without the gold link bracelet at less than <number> and the model with the bracelet just above <number> the economics of the apple gold could allow pricing with iphone-level profit margins to be <number> and <number> respectively for those expecting price points of <number> and <number> or <number> and <number> this reasonable pricing would be a welcome surprise
58 as surprising as it is that the high-end edition could contain so little actual gold this is not at all a bad thing not only will this new process make the apple watch edition lighter for delicate wrists and more resiliant but it also might help the cause of relatively affordable luxury that apple has championed more significantly this level of innovation in manufacturing follows through on apples commitment to using fewer resources in its products and since the mining of gold involves a lot of dangerous and underregulated human labor its a win in an area that apple has taken a lot of heat about for years from the investor point of view if the gold apple watch is a hit like the iphone <number> plus has been the money saved on gold will add meaningfully to apples already healthy bottom line
58 update as reader michal kvasnica points out the apple watch edition will literally be worth its weight in gold my original headline was intended rhetorically not literally apple can claim its new gold metal matrix composite is <number> karat because it will be <number> solid gold by weight the overall weight per volume is where apple has achieved the savings the low-density ceramic particles represent a surprising proportion of the volume of the material but still only contribute <number> to the weight since no one will buy an apple watch edition with the intention of melting it down for gold the real point is that apple gold is great from an engineering perspective but bad in terms of intrinsic value passing the savings along to the already overpaying consumer reinforces apples affordable luxury brand promise a <number> starting price in my opinion would be abusing that promise
2107 christina fernndez de kirchner the president of argentina got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a <number>-year-old jewish boy named yair tawil as her godson the independent reports her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves
2107 in argentina the werewolf is referred to as el lobison in paraguay it goes by the name luison and in brazil it 's called the lobisomem the independent elaborates on the south american legend
2107 the werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first friday after boys <number>th birthday the legend says turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form
2107 as well as feeding on excrement unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite
2107 in guaran mythology the lobison is the offspring of tau an evil spirit and kerana a mortal woman in the cultures that believe in the lobison that creature acts as a sort of grim reaper whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with as the independent explains by the <number>th century fear of this creature was so acute in argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true so in <number> in an attempt to stop this practice the argentinean president began adopting seventh sons which the president insisted would stop the curse in <number> the independent adds the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters
2107 in addition to being able to say he 's the president 's godson tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship in modern times the curse it seems is more aptly described as a blessing

2110 the apple watch is expected to be the main attraction at next weeks spring forward event but according to a new report the long-rumored <number>-inch retina macbook air could make a surprise appearance at the yerba buena center for the arts
2110 the sketchy rumor comes from the michael report which claims its sources inside apple say the companys long-awaited update to the macbook air will be announced march <number>
2110 sources familiar with the matter within apple have exclusively told the michael report that apple plans to unveil the long-awaited retina macbook air at the same event the michael report has independently verified this information to be highly credible
2110 obviously we cant verify the accuracy of the report the michael report unearthed full details of the ipad air <number> before the products announcement in october of last year however the publication also whiffed on some iphone <number> launch details including the name of the iphone <number> plus and the nexus <number>
2110 were not really expecting any hardware other than the apple watch at next weeks event but cupertino could surprise us the last time the macbook air line was upgraded was april <number> which was just a small spec bump so its due for an update
2110 hardware leaks of the <number>-inch macbook air have been scarce although multiple reports have confirmed that apple is working on the device the new retina macbook air will supposedly feature a fan-less design made possible by intels next-gen broadwell processors its also rumored that the new device will only have one usb-c port and a headphone jack

71 the next iphone 's camera may see a massive leap in image quality apple insider reports if it gets the rumoured inclusion of optical image zoom for the first time
71 the apple news site is basing its report off rumours heard by the japanese-language udn and its ever-reliable sources in the asian supply chain
71 currently the iphone like almost every other smartphone makes use of digital zoom with digital zoom zooming in does n't add any extra detail to your photo it just enlarges and enhances what 's already captured in contrast optical zoom uses an actual lens to to magnify and capture significantly more detail without sacrificing image quality
71 the camera in the iphone <number> is already highly praised but the rumoured new version will reportedly make use of a new dual-lens system to aid magnification like compact cameras and professional slrs
71 it 's a rumour in keeping with what we ve already heard about the next iphone blogger and developer john gruber who has an excellent track record on apple product news said that the next model may have the biggest camera jump ever
71 i ve heard that it 's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses gruber said and it somehow takes it up into dslr quality imagery

92 the guardian reports that the woman was sleeping on the floor while the autonomous roving vacuum did its job
92 but disaster struck when her hair became trapped in the mechanism after the machine mistook it for dust
92 fortunately the <number>-year-old woman from changing city was able to get help in time
92 the woman was immediately woken by the pain and called the local fire department with what the yonhap news agency reported as a desperate rescue plea

96 the news if you ve been keeping up with the images of protests coming out of hong kong you might have noticed a recurring gesture among the protesters that 's right to demonstrate peaceful intent to the riot police protesters have been raising their empty hands in the air

96 source anadolu agencygetty images a common thread as many online commentators have noted there 's a striking similarity between the gesture of the umbrella revolution taking place in hong kong and the hands up do n't shoot gesture from the protests in ferguson mo
96 is there an actual connection it does n't look like the hands-up gesture by hong kong protesters is a callback to the events still unfolding in ferguson as reported by quartz the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police
96 while the gesture might not have been a deliberate cultural reference like thai protesters adopting the hunger games salute the unplanned nature of its similarity to the ferguson gesture makes it all the more powerful although the two sites of protest are a world apart from each other and are fighting against very different sociopolitical issues both movements are dealing with police brutality and demonstrating peaceful intent in an act of nonviolent civil unrest
96 and the fact that ferguson protesters are marching in solidarity with the hong kong protesters makes it all the more moving

2169 microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the maker of the game minecraft for more than <number> billion people briefed on the discussions said on tuesday the move was intended to ensure that one of the most popular games was available for the computing giants family of devices
2169 the sides still need to work out many details and a deal could fall through according to one of these people who spoke on condition of anonymity
2169 acquiring minecraft would give microsoft control of an online world that has defied many of the conventions of the modern games business to become a blockbuster success
2169 minecrafts blocky graphics are crude by todays standards looking like virtual lego bricks but unlike many of the start-ups purchased by big technology companies for billions of dollars minecraft is already a lucrative business this year mojang the privately held swedish company that makes minecraft told the wall street journal that its revenue was about <number> million last year up <number> percent from the year before the journal reported the discussions with microsoft earlier on tuesday mojang was co-founded by markus persson a <number>-year-old programmer and game designer who is better known in the gaming world by his gamer name notch mr persson has said in the past that he did not want to sell the company or take money from outside investors in an era when many games especially for mobile devices are given away and derive their profit from the sale of virtual currency and other items mojang sells minecraft the old-fashioned way by charging people to buy a copy the price varies depending on what kind of device people use to play the game ranging from <number> on mobile phones to <number> for computer versions a version of minecraft for microsofts xbox which has been a top seller for the console costs <number>
2169 for microsoft the interest in a deal is motivated in large part by a desire to ensure that attractive content is available for some of its most important platforms minecraft is not currently available on windows phone the mobile operating system that microsoft has struggled to turn into a strong competitor to apples iphone and googles android
2169 minecraft has also not been adapted to take advantage of the graphical interface of microsofts latest operating system for computers and tablets windows <number> the game is not available for purchase in the windows store microsofts online app store
2169 gaming remains one of the most popular applications for mobile devices and computers the lack of timely versions of top titles for its devices has been a problem for microsoft as it tries to compete more aggressively with rivals like apple samsung and google by the standards of microsoft which had nearly <number> billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of june a <number> billion-plus deal would be relatively small because mojang is a european company microsoft would be able to use cash from overseas operations to fund the deal a more attractive prospect than bringing the cash back to the united states where it would be subject to hefty repatriation taxes
2169 a spokeswoman for microsoft declined to comment mr persson did not respond to a request for comment
2169 microsoft first approached mojang about three months ago interested in pursuing a deal one of the people briefed on the discussions said by that point the company and mr persson in particular had considered a sale having received takeover approaches worth about <number> billion in the last few years

2173 seoul feb <number> korea bizwire a powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused an unlikely accident involving a korean housewife and required the intervention of a couple of paramedics on january <number> a woman in her fifties had her hair sucked up into a robot vacuum at her home in the city of changwon south korea
2173 on the day of the accident she turned on her robot vacuum as usual and laid down flat on the floor to rest leaving the robot to do its job the robot vacuum came around her relaxing on the floor and suddenly sucked her hair into its nozzle the vacuum stopped running one to two minutes after the sudden hair intake
2173 the startled housewife called <number> koreas emergency telephone number fortunately paramedics quickly arrived at the scene and successfully disjoined her hair from the nozzle the housewife suffered only minor injuries
2173 the problematic robot vacuum had a nozzle with a roller inside which sweeps and vacuums floors the changwon fire service headquarters presumed that the vacuums sensors identified the womans hair as dust
2173 the likelihood of this type accident occurring is undoubtedly more significant in countries with a sitting-on-the-floor culture since koreans love to rest or relax on a toasty cleanly swept floor exercising caution on using a robot vacuum is probably a good idea

131 this attack is very significant it is the first infantry-like complex and penetrating attack in baghdad city by isis since the fall of mosul in june of this year the washington-based nonprofit institute for the study of war wrote on its website referring to iraq 's second-largest city which is in the islamic state 's hands isis likely carried out the attack to release some of the pressure it is facing as a result of the recent us air campaign targeting its positions the attack also signifies that despite the heightened defenses of baghdad in the aftermath of the fall of mosul isis is still able to carry out attacks in an area where it is unlikely to have active sleeper cells
131 us-led airstrikes against isis in iraq and syria have come under criticism over their effectiveness us secretary of state john kerry defended the military action last week in a cnn interview kerry claimed baghdad could have fallen if it were n't for the airstrikes which have predominantly been launched in the northern part of iraq

138 according to simone star isnt quite the deranged manson maniac we all thought she was she was a woman with a plan not a good plan necessarily but a plan
138 when manson keeled over star reportedly envisioned putting the murderous cult leader on display lenin-style in a glass coffin so she could charge money to morbid looky-loos
138 manson was allegedly less-than-pleased with this idea and called off the unholy prison wedding potentially the only good thing hes ever done his life the post has all the details including this masterpiece of insanity
138 another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal he feels he will never die simone said therefore he feels its a stupid idea to begin with
138 manson is housed in california state prison corcoran and is presumably now looking for a life partner who is not interested in profiting off his disgusting corpse please send all applications straight to an incinerator and seek professional help immediately

2209 some birds want the whole package
2209 none more so than a particularly demanding snowy owl in poland who killed her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis
2209 the bird nicknamed the black widow left her suitor half-eaten shocking vets at the animal shelter in knyszynska forest
2209 park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate
2209 but just two days after arriving from germany they found the new owl devoured and dead
2209 shelter spokesman robert konowal said the first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well
2209 we were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him
2209 at first we couldnt understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped
2209 in other words he wasnt a suitable lover and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him probably out of frustration
163 in a day packed with major apple announcements the company tackled smartphones wearables and payments but there is one more sector that may be about to get the apple treatment social
163 according to a single well-placed source inside apples engineering team the company is poised to announce an acquisition of dave morins path social network to quote our source who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet its almost done if not signed already but its essentially a done deal
163 if true it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers particularly in non-asian markets apple hasnt fared much better in the social realm historically having flopped with its ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and ip from failed location-based photo social network color
163 according to our source this is more than just a talent acquisition or acquihire the path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated in whole or in part into apples newly refreshed messages app that doesnt mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals namely facebooks <number> billion whatsapp acquisition and rumored <number> billion-plus offers extended to snapchat by facebook and google
163 facebook paid <number> per whatsapp user and <number> per instagram user before that by comparison rakuten bought the far less beloved viber for just <number> per user with path having somewhere in the vicinity of <number> million users at the beginning of this year and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms it would be lucky to command anywhere near instagramwhatsapp sums according to app annie path ranks just <number>th among ios social networking apps in the us and not among the top <number> overall ios apps when path raised its most recent round in january of this year the company reportedly commanded a sub-<number> million valuation well below the <number> million-plus levels reportedly sought by management given the trajectory it was on exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most path insiders hell for many valley observers that would be the win of the century for path investors many of which have all but left the company for dead
163 apples re-entry into social would also be a notable development with facebook including instagram and whatsapp twitter and snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals its unclear just where an apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits google seems to have reached a similar conclusion all but abandoning its strategy of pushing google as a standalone social platform and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like gmail and youtube apples one stronghold has been in messaging via imessage which recently got a facelift and path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product abandoning its long-held love of more lasting intimate communications its certainly conceivable that path could be integrated into apples messaging platform but its unclear beyond the design prowess how this acquisition helps apple at any price
163 adding additional fuel to this fire dave morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays apple keynote event a high profile position reserved for dr dre and other key apple insiders
163 did not forget about dre urlzz dave morin userzz september <number> <number>
163 apple has been known to be a fan of morins as well as the path design aesthetic and broader design team take for example the companys decision to feature the path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns in that sense it wouldnt be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated jason calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today noting morins seating at todays event and apples long-standing frustrations around social others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years

2291 jasmine tridevil not her birth name says she spoke with over <number> cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for <number>
2291 they put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out she told the news junkie an orlando radio show and for a while it didnt have an areola but i got a tattoo the motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to total recall apparently but because tridevil wants to become unattractive since she is not interested in dating anymore this is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper
2291 she says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that mtv will give her a reality tv show
2291 i saved up for two years and i didnt spend any of that money she said im dumping every penny i have into this so if it doesnt work im through

246 so much for tesla bringing its <number>-billion battery factory to southern dallas county according to the wall street journal the company has decided to take its operations to nevada a press conference is allegedly scheduled in carson city tomorrow
246 per marketwatch tesla said last month it had broken ground on a site in storey county east of reno but added that it will still be looking at other sites in other states as a final location would depend on what agreements and incentives it could get from whichever state it chooses
246 in july tesla spokeswoman alexis georgeson said the company was looking at a bunch of different locations and have not confirmed anything but in recent days and weeks it became increasingly clear nevada was the clear favorite
246 earlier this week the associated press broke down the incentives that could have been offered by some of the contenders texas among them california arizona and new mexico were also on the short list but nevada had some significant advantages among them proximity to the assembly plant in fremont california where tesla makes its cars significant deposit of lithium which is essential to making the batteries said the ap report

248 cnn  the mother of james foley  an american journalist beheaded by isis militants  said she is embarrassed and appalled by how the us government dealt with her son 's case telling cnn that officials even suggested family members could be charged if they raised ransom to free him
248 i think our efforts to get jim freed were an annoyance to the us government diane foley told cnn 's anderson cooper in an interview that aired thursday it did n't seem to be in us strategic interest if you will
248 officials told foley family members not go to the media and that the government would not exchange prisoners or carry out military action to try to rescue her son according to diane foley
248 jim was killed in the most horrific way he was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination lack of communication lack of prioritization diane foley said as a family we had to find our way through this on our own
248 she added that the family was told many times that raising ransom was illegal and we might be prosecuted
248 we were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow miraculously foley 's mother told cnn and he was n't was he
248 in fact video posted online on august <number> showed james foley kneeling next to a man dressed in black with foley reading a presumably scripted message that his real killer is america then being summarily executed
248 isis  the islamist extremist group that 's taken over large swaths of syria and iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of sharia law  took credit for foley 's beheading saying it was in response to us airstrikes in iraq and threatening more killings
248 our government needs to be willing to negotiate 
249 amid conflicting reports an islamic state isis spokesperson has confirmed the militant group 's leader abu bakr al-baghdadi has been injured in a recent us air strike
249 the us has not yet confirmed whether al-baghdadi was among the wounded in the attack but iraqi security officials have been quoted as saying he was injured
249 nonetheless abu mohammed al-adnani an official spokesperson for the sunni insurgent group wrote on twitter the leader of the isil is abu bakr al-baghdad has been injured
249 do you think the state of khilafa will end by the death of the caliphate we assure for the state that the amir abu bakr al-baghdadi is fine and we ask his followers to pray for god for his safety
249 some have questioned the credibility of the twitter account
249 the us air strike which took place in the is-controlled city of mosul was targeted at top leaders of the extremist organisation local officials in mosul said more than <number> bodies were brought to a morgue following the us aerial bombardment
249 this strike demonstrates the pressure we continue to place on the isil is terrorist network and the group 's increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre communicate and command the us central command said
249 the iraqi state television reported that al-baghdadi 's top aide was also killed in the air strike but it could not be independently verified
249 there were rumours earlier regarding al-baghdadi 's injury or death however these turned out to be false

2319 james foley was courageous and his murder by an apparently english-accented zealot of the syria-based islamic state was so horrific that no simple narrative can do it justice unless that is you 're a conservative political opportunist of a special sort eager to pin the crime on liberal policies
2319 the right wing drunk on a fermenting rotgut of hyperpatriotism and anti-left paranoia just knows that foley 's murderers were enabled by bleeding hearts and due process they think they ve found proof that foley 's executioner was a prisoner freed from the us detention facility at guantanamo bay maybe it was even barack hussein obama himself who gave the order to free this killer
2319 unnamed aggregators at twitchy the dittoheads who stare at tweets were the first to round up grumblingsor perhaps hopesamong right-wingers early wednesday that foley 's murderer was freed from the detainee pool these tinfoil hatters took their inspiration from two anonymously sourced paragraphs buried in an early washington post report on foley 's murder from tuesday
2319 translation flummoxed uk intel officials were checking the murder against the usual suspects hoping to stumble onto a clue in the tiny pool of data they already had before reluctantly wading into the murkier waters of global jihadism that 's standard sleuthing
2319 and it 's sadly unsurprising that the islamic state 's propagandists dressed foley up in an oversized t-shirt mimicking the infamous orange jumpsuits put on problem detainees at gitmo al qaeda in iraq had similarly garbed several of its condemned captives in outfits imitating the jumpsuitsenduring symbols of the mistreatments real and supposed of gitmo inmates
2319 but to islamophobic gitmo-loving conservatives these paragraphs could mean so much more
2319 presumably tsotsoros meant the bush administration since it 's the one that released all of the <number> british citizens that have been repatriated from guantanamo all between <number> and <number> and york 's choice of ellipses is deceptive since it implies that the post was referring to some of those ex-detainees as syria-based jihadists when it also was referencing a larger pool of some <number> to <number> other british citizens that have traveled to fight for isis none of the uk 's ex-gitmo inmates is believed to have gone to syria except moazzam begg who has been in british custody since february on charges related to his travels
2319 but never let facts get in the way of a good psychotic bs meme by wednesday morning hot air 's ed morrisey was just asking questions and the game of right-wing telephone was on
2319 by wednesday night the gitmo link had become likely on conservative twitter

318 apple originally planned for the apple watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this april the wall street journal reports
318 the apple watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin you sweat more if you 're nervous and that makes your skin more conductive
318 the watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user 's heart rate that 's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse but apple could n't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted it found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors and the watch did n't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist
318 other features that did n't make it into the final apple watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking according to the journal those would have been tricky for apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the fda food and drug administration in the us we do know however that apple secretly met with the fda in <number> to find out which features would come under the agency 's regulation
318 apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the apple watch because it simply could n't get them to work that does n't mean that it is n't going to add them back in future versions of the device though
318 elsewhere in its article the journal says the apple watch was known at apple by the name black hole because it kept drawing in more and more resources development of the device reportedly took over four years

2428 it wasnt very long ago that nhl commissioner gary bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if hed like an epidemic of ebola
2428 but recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if but when
2428 and then the ultimate question will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two
2428 sources close to the situation have indicated las vegas is a done deal the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to sin city
2428 and given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was <number> years ago this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed
2428 but people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldnt be fixed just as easily anywhere as in vegas is pretty ridiculous so that posturing has fallen by the wayside
2428 a new team close to the newly renamed arizona squad and californias big three is all but assured the only question being when and with which other city or should that be plural
2428 with all the activity going on in the seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing
2428 at the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink but that could change at any time with vancouver billionaire victor coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an nhl team into the city
325 yes that 's right last week argentine president cristina fernndez de kirchner adopted a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf according to multiple news reports she tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of yair tawil the seventh child of an argentine jewish family during which the tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah

325 a tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf known as el lobison in argentina after his <number>th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form feeding on the dead and murdering all before it the legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of european settlers in the <number>th century the fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born which started the practice in <number> of argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing
325 in the past half-century the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now for the first time jews the tawil family appealed to the argentine government as early as the <number>s to have the practice extended to non-catholic families the boy 's new status as the president 's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship according to the independent
325 tales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of latin america this argentine iteration can be traced to a local guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of tau an evil mythological spirit and kerana a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped the seventh son was luison who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and eats corpses
325 some historians dispute the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson and suggest the latter is a distinct custom brought over by eastern european migrants

328 last week president cristina kirchner adopted a jewish teenager named yair tawil and posted pictures of the event on her twitter feed outlets around the world ran with the story explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves in western folklore only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite but in argentina the story 's a little different the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row according to said folklore seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their <number>th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse thus the need for presidential action is pretty clear
328 the notion of animal shifting came from different native american traditions oscar chamosa a folklorist at the university of georgia told me the idea of el lobison comes from uturuncoor the were-jaguarwhich mixed with the european notion of the werewolf chamosa says he 's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys
328 but even if someone who 's devoted his entire life to studying argentine folklore ca n't explain it the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early <number>th century and catholics in argentina were producing enough seventh children that the myth became a public policy problem after all terrified parents were according to legend at least regularly committing infanticide
328 in order to counteract the myth argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family chamosa explains adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons the rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it
328 this idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies so it was a smart move on part of the argentine government but if it 's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago it 's downright bizarre that they 're still entertaining the notion of it today
328 as per a decree that came out in <number> adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship and argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children because in <number> the adoption ceremony was extended to non-catholics as the independent noted tawil is the first jewish boy to receive the honor so while a werewolf bar mitzvah might be a joke on <number> rock it 's also apparently a real thing that just happened in south america
328 the boy 's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in <number> but were denied they applied again after the rules changed to include jews in <number> a tweet from president kirchner 's account shows her lighting a menorah with the tawils quite the gesture given that the jewish population of argentina is less than half of one percent
328 jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event and angry commenters are freaking out about a jew being adoptedeven symbolicallyby a non-jew and the blasphemous concept of a jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves in jewish folklore people do n't turn into werewolves and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed
328 but most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition like for instance that 's it 's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies
329 a south african man paid the price for secretly filming he and his girlfriend having sex when she threw acid on his penis

2378 north korean despot and owner of the world 's worst hipster haircut kim jong-un is reportedly dying because he is addicted to elemental cheese
2378 jong-un studied in switzerland during his teenager years however it 's unknown if he developed a taste for the hole-riddled cheese there or when he became ruler of north korea
2378 according to sources who have fled the communist dictatorship jong-un is ballooning in weight and is even walking with a limp
2378 in north korean culture being fat and overweight is considered a sign of wealth and good luck hence why it 's believed that jong-un is bulking up on weight for that very reason
2378 others believe it 's so that he can look more like his grandfather and found of north korea kim il-sung
2378 we could all be wrong and maybe jong-un is bulking up so he can start his weight-lifting career and fight obama in a one-on-one battle royale like he 's always going on about

2430 authorities in iraq were tonight investigating claims that the isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi had been critically injured in us-led air strikes prompting speculation of his death
2430 the death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the us-led effort to curtail the islamist extremist group britains chief of the defence staff general sir nicholas houghton warned however that the isis leadership would regenerate even if baghdadi had been killed
2430 general houghton told the bbc i cant absolutely confirm that baghdadi has died even the americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation
2430 fridays strikes destroyed an isis convoy near the iraqi city of mosul but us officials said it was unclear whether the groups top commander had been in any of the <number> targeted vehicles tribal sources told the saudi news channel al arabiya that after the strike isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al-qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured

2435 it 's a safe bet that sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman of saudi arabia 's religious police is n't a fan of cole porter the lure of you is precisely why nabet announced yesterday that the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice will cover any women 's eyes that are deemed tempting the men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes especially the tempting ones he said we have the right to do so what are tempting eyes one saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup or even without makeup if they are beautiful the woman will be in trouble the orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting but if they happen to rely on merriam-webster then it means having an appeal what is an appeal according to the dictionary it is arousing a sympathetic response and what is sympathetic showing empathy according to merriam-webster
2435 so there you have it to allow a women 's eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world one must empathize with her very existence but the religious police  massively funded by king abdullah  can not do this it 's so stupid the saudi journalist tells me i do n't know what to say they have to stop this many people will oppose this in the country they wo n't be silent
2435 perhaps they wo n't be but the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country prince naif recently appointed heir to the throne has said the committee is supported by all sides it should be supported because it is a pillar from islam if you are a muslim you should support the committee no surprise then that king abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional <number> million riyals about <number> million in march
2435 how should america respond to this latest affront to saudi women perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in saudi arabia women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany president obama during his next meeting with the saudi dictator
2435 if congress reconsidered the recent <number> billion us-saudi arms deal the religious police might quickly find it tempting to stop treating women as property

412 a <number>-year-old girl has stunned her teacher by penning him a touching note after he came out to his class as gay
412 the teacher told the class of primary school children about his sexuality after the majority of his students admitted to having heard the word gay used in a derogatory way and believing that gay men and lesbians were bad or in some way wrong during a class on bullying and homophobia
412 he explained to pink news after speaking to my head who was very supportive we agreed i could tell the class that im gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word theyre talking about me
412 and although the news was well received by the class he was taken aback when the unnamed student slipped him this heartfelt note a few days later
412 the note opens with the line even though youre gay i will always treat you the same way as i do now and concludes you dont have to feel scared because i know that everone in the class feels the same way as i do
412 the teacher told pink news reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself when i thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson its just your life then she went back to her maths
412 what an inspirational little girl

2461 apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development according to the wall street journal the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate blood pressure and stress levels based on the conductivity of the skin unfortunately the sensors they tested just did n't pass muster which is n't entirely surprising since we ve reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past the company 's engineers found that hairy arms dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results and they did n't find a solution in time
2461 apple watch became known as a black hole within the company the wsj 's sources said as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time the lineup of watches due out in april are a lot different from the original one apple envisioned and are more of an iphone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer
2461 still the company 's expecting to sell a ton reportedly ordering around <number> million units from its asian suppliers just for the first quarter half of those are the entry-level apple watch sports while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number as for cupertino 's original vision well there 's always a chance that we 'll see it come to life in the coming years the company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears  the first iphone did n't have <number>g

469 many people havent even gotten their iphone <number> devices yet and already the rumors are starting up about what apple has planned for its next generation handsets
469 one slightly sketchy rumor citing sources in the apple supply chain in china suggests <number>s iphone lineup could include a <number>-inch model in line with the size of the iphone <number> and <number>s according to the report the idea would be to appeal to female users who are put off by the larger screen size of the iphone <number> and <number> plus
469 the rumor doesnt elaborate on whether apple would create a new <number>-inch iphone from scratch or refresh a previously launched model instead
469 were not convinced
469 personally id suggest the report is <number> percent likely to be nonsense apple only just upgraded to the larger screen size with the iphone <number> and <number> plus to both critical and commercial acclaim between them the two handsets smashed records with <number> million sales in their first weekend on sale and analysts are predicting <number> million more units will sell over the holidays

2518 over the last few months the us has ratcheted up military efforts against the islamic militant group isis in a big way whether engaging in airstrikes to push them out of key points of infrastructure like the mosul dam in iraq or targeting convoys to try to destabilize the terrorist organization the fighting has been ongoing and now there are reports that the biggest target of all may have been struck iraqi defense minister khaled al-abadi has claimed that isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was injured by american airstrikes friday night the first such reports of an actual brush between al-baghdadi and us forces
2518 not much is known about the background of al-baghdadi the self-proclaimed caliph of the new islamic state hes believed to be in his early forties and ascended to the top of isis back in <number> but the vast majority of his personal biography is unclear whats transparently clear however is the authority he asserts worldwide isis vision of a caliphate with al-baghdadi sitting at the top is one which all muslims would be forced to recognize if the group had its way
2518 in short theyve cut a fantastically bloody course through iraq and syria killing muslims christians and non-believers alike theyve also notably released multiple videos of grisly hostage executions including those of americans steven sotloff and james foley
2518 as always caution is important the us hasnt confirmed these reports just yet as colonel pat ryder of centcom told fox news on sunday saying we have no information to corroborate press reports that isil leader al-baghdadi has been injured on saturday ryder did acknowledge that the airstrikes had gone down however hitting targets near mosul
2518 i can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series of air strikes yesterday evening in iraq against what was assessed to be a gathering of isil leaders near mosul we can not confirm if isil leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was among those present
2518 hopefully the situation will become clearer in the coming days reports of al-baghdadis injury have been cited by multiple news outlets including israeli papers haaretz and the jerusalem post british paper the guardian and time but until theres official word on the matter its best not to get too ahead of things and its also important not to assume that al-baghdadi being injured or even being killed means that isis will fall apart
2518 the feeling of futility that sometimes comes with large-scale military battles against far-flung terrorist organizations comes from the ability of these groups to restructure and destabilize themselves even when a leader dies as demonstrated by the example of al-qaeda and leader ayman al-zawahiri for example whos been in command long after the death of osama bin laden basically whether al-baghdadi is in charge or not isis will likely remain a worrying and potent force in the region and one which the us wont be done engaging with

2198 even if you are christian or are against transgender people dont ever say that to someone especially your kid that wont do anything but make them hate them self thats exactly what it did to me

2198 when i was <number> i realized that my parents would never come around and that i would have to wait until i was <number> to start any sort of transitioning treatment which absolutely broke my heart the longer you wait the harder it is to transition i felt hopeless that i was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life

489 probably false
489 example collected via twitter october <number> crabzilla photo appears <number> show giant crab measuring at least <number>ft across lurking it waters off whitstable really urlzz babble userzz october <number> <number>

491 iphone<number>-stock according to supply chain sources the lpddr<number> ram modules for the iphone <number>s will be supplied primarily by hynix samsung and micron-elpida elpida reportedly was behind schedule but the company allegedly improved its manufacturing process to a level that will meet apple 's demand micron-elpida and hynix were identified in ifixit teardown analyses as the ram suppliers for apple 's current iphone <number> and <number> plus models

2541 problem last year the average american consumed <number> eggs  over <number> percent more than the world per-capita average because egg yolks are high in cholesterol eating whole eggs increases cholesterol a known risk factor for coronary artery disease cad and heart attacks previous research also links cad with cigarette smoke
2541 methodology canadian researchers examined <number> patients at london 's health sciences centre 's university hospital the average age of all the patients was <number> ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries established the presence and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque and the scans were accompanied by lifestyle surveys smoking was measured in pack-years number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years spent smoking egg yolk consumption was measured in egg yolk-years
2541 results aging was associated with a linear increase in arterial plaque after age <number> but smoking and egg consumption were each independently associated with an exponential increase in plaque egg consumption had two-thirds of the effect of smoking
2541 conclusion egg yolks are almost as bad for your carotid arteries as smoking
2541 implication while the link between eggs and cholesterol  and between cholesterol and heart disease  is well established this study sheds light on the extent of their potential harm if eaten routinely in large quantities a single large egg contains more than <number> mg of cholesterol  more than a third of a person 's daily recommended intake by this measure a typical american breakfast alone with two eggs plus bacon would push well past that egg whites meanwhile remain excellent
2541 source the full study egg yolk consumption and carotid plaque is published in the journal atherosclerosis
2542 remember the <number>s when doctors equated eggs with cholesterol and heart disease a recent canadian study involving over <number> adults published in the peer-reviewed journal atherosclerosis says that eating eggs yolks is about as bad as smoking cigarettes when it comes to advancing coronary heart disease were already seeing cracks in the theory
2542 in the study researchers recorded the number of eggs eaten and packs of cigarettes smoked as recalled by each adult average age <number> everyone in the study had been referred to a vascular prevention clinic at a canadian hospital meaning their heart health and the habits that led them there was already in question the researchers found that as expected plaque build-up in their subjects carotid artery thickened with age and even correlated with smoking and egg-eating habits
2542 publications like the daily mail and fox news have reported blindly on the matter but thankfully there are others out there suspiciously raising eyebrows
2542 the uks national health service points out some of the studys limitations including
2542 the accuracy of the participants recollections of egg yolk consumption a lack of details regarding how the eggs were cooked or not disregard for other factors of heart disease advancement including but not limited to exercise alcohol consumption antidepressant use antidepressants have been shown to cause arteries to thicken <number> faster than aging and other important dietary factors neither the study in question nor the nhs takes into consideration however
2542 the harmful effects of the chemicals and hormones found in non-organic eggs the effects on the human body from eating eggs from chicken given gmo feed the living condition of the chickens non-organic eggs can contain the same antibiotics chemicals and hormones administered to conventional chickens add gmo feed polluted water and unsanitary living conditions to these chickens and you may have eggs that are little more than hard-shelled pellets of poison
2542 organic eggs from healthy chickens on gmo-free feed have actually shown in many studies to prevent heart disease they contain healthful amounts of protein vitamin b omega-<number> fatty acids and many nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin which reduce risk for age-related macular degeneration amd a major cause of blindness
2542 the key moderation as with most things and buying organic eggs from local farmers who can raise their chickens in truly cage-free conditions happy healthy chickens produce more healthful eggs
2543 conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease

2543 procter and gamble decided to promote the fat as a healthier all-vegetable-derived shortening
2543 according to lewrockwellcom
2543 feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores like rats and dogs does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them
2543 in fact it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease

2545 saturated fats have long been called `` bad fats  for their effect on the heart but a new analysis calls into question whether they 're really that bad after all
2545 the findings published in the annals of internal medicine have sparked renewed debate about fats and heart health
2545 the new study should trigger a review of current diet guidelines for heart health according to the researchers who did the analysis other experts including one from the american heart association disagree
2545 there is some common ground all agree that dietary fat is just one factor that drives heart disease risk paying attention to the other factors is also important
2545 webmd asked a study co-author a cardiologist a nutrition expert and the american heart association to elaborate
2545 what did the analysis look at and find
2545 researchers looked at <number> published studies on fats and heart disease the studies involved more than <number> people from <number> countries some people already had heart disease while others did not the researchers reanalyzed the results an approach called a meta-analysis
2545 they looked at whether different fats helped or hurt your heart the different fats included
2545 saturated fats found in meats whole-fat dairy products and baked goods polyunsaturated fats such as omega-<number> and omega-<number> found in fish nuts seeds and vegetable oils monounsaturated fats found in olive and canola oils trans fats found in fried foods and baked goods and being phased out of the food supply the surprise saturated fats long thought to raise heart disease risks had no effect neither did monounsaturated fats which are thought to help the heart says study researcher dariush mozaffarian md at the harvard school of public health
2546 poor old saturated fat for over forty years now its been spoken of only in hushed tones dissed as nothing but artery clogging obesity-causing poison this common sense fact has become so widely accepted that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchasing skim milk ditching their egg yolks and beginning a life free of steak pork and butter
2546 its time to bring bacon back to breakfast after all saturated fat is good for you
2546 weve made a huge mistake
2546 but we all make mistakes this one started in <number> with the first publication of the seven countries study the research looked at the incidences of saturated fat intake and heart disease among <number> men from you guessed it seven different countries and showed a correlation between the two
2546 unfortunately the study was deeply flawed it didnt take into account important factors like smoking rates sugar consumption and exercise levels and it left out an awful lot of data from other countries that contradicted the conclusions the studys authors actually had access to twenty-two countries data and didnt discuss any of the populations that followed diets with plenty of saturated fat and barely experienced any heart disease such communities include the kenyan masai the tokelau in polynesia and the arctic inuit
2546 governments followed by making the supposed saturated fat-heart disease connection a matter of public health policy an ideology which probably culminated with the abominable food pyramid of the <number>s which recommended up to <number> servings of rice and pasta per day and about as little fat as possible
2546 the result in the past <number> years in the united states the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from <number> percent to <number> percent while obesity has doubled and heart disease has remained the countrys number one killer
2546 but the spread of obesity has no single cause there are a lot of complicated factors that have led to americas health crisis to figure out whether saturated fat should be added back into our diets lets take a closer look at its effect on the body
2546 why saturated fat does n't cause heart disease
2547 saturated fat has been a controversial subject in recent years with some research suggesting that it may not be as bad for health as once thought but a new study published in the bmj dashes any hope that butter is actually back
2547 cutting down on saturated fatty acidsfound in animal foods like dairy and meat as well as palm and coconut oilmay lower risk of coronary heart disease according to researchers and swapping these foods for unsaturated fats from vegetable oils nuts seeds avocados and seafood for example whole grains and plant-based proteins think lentils and edamame seems to boost heart health even further
2547 the new findings are significant because saturated fat has been a source of debate studies have shown that saturated fatty acids can affect cholesterol but there 's has n't been any definitive research linking them to overall heart health a large meta-analysis published this summer for example found that butter consumption does not appear to raise heart disease risk
2547 the current us dietary guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats saying they should make up no more than <number> of total calories qi sun md assistant professor of nutrition in the harvard t h chan school of public health and senior author of the new study says his groups findings back up this advice
2547 related <number> healthy high-fat foods you should eat
2547 the new study also bolsters government recommendations for eating an overall healthful diet dr sun told healthone that includes fruits vegetables whole grains vegetable cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats the two main types of unsaturated fats nuts legumes fish and low-fat dairy
2547 to determine saturated fats long-term effects on heart health he and his colleagues followed more than <number> women and <number> men for an average of <number> years collecting data on their diet and health every four years
2547 after controlling for factors such as age ethnicity and other potential influencers the researchers found that participants who consumed the most calories from four commonly consumed saturated fatty acidslauric acid myristic acid plametic acid and stearic acidwere <number> more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consumed the least
2547 some researchers have suggested putting individual limits on each of these fatty acids said co-author frank hu phd professor of nutrition and epidemiology in a press release but thats not practical he argues since they share many of the same food sources red meat dairy fat butter lard and palm oil
2548 a workout so intense that it worries some professionals is set to become the fitness trend of <number> high intensity training hit used to be the preserve of the most dedicated fitness fanatics but is heading into the mainstream with one of the uk 's largest gym companies capitalising on its popularity
2548 fitness first is launching tabata classes containing a four-minute form of hit in <number> of its london gyms this month before rolling out the classes nationwide to its <number> members in the new year
2548 the chain claims the tabata method has been scientifically proven to be the most effective way to increase both aerobic and anaerobic fitness its website cites tests using the system which it says increased vo<number> max the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise by <number> in six weeks it says a trial using <number>-second bursts of intensity with two-minute rest periods was not as effective
2548 japanese scientist professor izumi tabata gave his name to the method while working with his country 's olympic speed-skating team his routine consisted of a combination of <number> seconds of intense exercise followed by <number> seconds of rest to a rotation lasting four minutes
2548 fitness first 's website states professor tabata 's latest research shows that if his regime is followed correctly the body will continue to consume more calories for up to <number> hours after the exercise class these are additional calories to those consumed by the body at rest so over and above the so-called rmb or resting metabolic rate
2548 the dangers of hit training especially for people who are middle-aged was highlighted this year when andrew marr said that the stroke which almost killed him occurred in the middle of an intense workout on his rowing machine at home
2548 fitness first 's online promotion does include an advisory note for anyone considering the tabata class to consult a doctor before beginning the routines especially if they have existing medical conditions a spokesman said the <number>-minute warm-up followed by a four-minute tabata rotation will reap the same benefits as an hour on an exercise bike cycling at moderate rate
2548 cardiologist and fitness enthusiast dr aseem malhotra questioned if hit is the best form of exercise although i do n't object in principle to high intensity training there is no long-term data into its benefits people exercise for all different reasons he said some like to push their body to the limits others do it competitively but for the majority it 's for improving overall health no one can doubt the multitude of benefits of regular exercise and as a regular gym enthusiast myself i know of the benefits as much as anyone but like anything too much exercise can be a bad thing with good data revealing that the greatest cardiovascular benefit for running was up to <number> miles a week at a moderate pace if you ran more than this at a faster pace the benefits started to get lost
2548 a study of up to <number> former olympic athletes published in the british medical journal revealed that in disciplines with high-intensity activity such as cycling boxing and rowing competitors did not live longer than those at low-intensity sports such as cricket and golf in fact those athletes who engaged in high intensity physical contact sports had a higher mortality than those in the lowest intensity said malhotra for the majority of the population improving longevity and general health can be done by brisk walking for <number> minutes three times a week and does n't involve spending money joining a gym

2550 vanilla exercise is pass fitness fan-atics are putting some shades of grey into their workouts opting for short sharp punishing regimes that promise to get you twice as fit in half the time of a regular gym session hiit high-intensity interval training sessions can last for just <number> minutes spend <number> seconds pushing your body and metabolism out of its comfort zone by working out as hard as you can say by sprinting then recover with lighter exercise such as jogging for <number> seconds before powering up again and again and again
2550 studies have shown that within months even weeks the bodys systems can adapt positively to the increases in stress and as a result fitness improves enormously research suggests that these regimes can help to reduce blood sugar levels and offset type <number> diabetes as well as improving strength endurance and muscle tone so no more excuses for those previously claiming to be too busy to work out
2550 and yet despite the evidence controversy is now clouding this intense exercise phenomenon with the bbc presenter andrew marrs revelation that he believes his recent stroke was linked to intense interval training on a rowing machine there is a fear that hiit can cause more harm than good because what all variations of these workouts share some focus on strength others on cardio is that they are punishing to the extreme so you have to be reasonably fit to begin with in order to try them safely this say experts is where some people are going wrong these types of sessions are not suitable for everyone says greg whyte professor of applied sport and exercise science at liverpool john moores university you need to have a good fitness background before you even take part pushing yourself to those limits is strongly inadvisable if you are in any way unfit or have underlying problems
2550 people mistakenly think that because they last for just a few minutes these workouts are an easy option dont be fooled steve barrett a personal trainer who has worked with leading athletes says they should leave you feeling as if you literally couldnt do anything more and that degree of effort says dr dominic micklewright director of the sport performance and fatigue research unit at the university of essex can mean there is almost certainly an increased risk of injury among untrained people with this sort of approach couple intense workouts with minimal calorie intake or fasting and you could find yourself suffering more for your fitness than you imagined with blood sugar levels too low to sustain you through these workouts headaches muscle weakness and nausea or feeling faint could result
2550 none of this means that as long as you are fit enough the high-intensity approach should be avoided barrett uses it with some of his fitter clients and says it should be employed two to four times a week in addition to run-of-the-mill activities such as steady running cycling or swimming and most experts agree that if you build up to it interval training of some sort is essential for fitness progression but that a watered-down version of hiit is more appropriate for the masses exercise scientists at mcmaster university in canada recently tried a gentler version of a hiit schedule involving a minute of effort followed by a minute of easy recovery repeated ten times over <number> minutes on a group including some previously unfit volunteers all displayed remarkable improvements in overall health and fitness after several weeks with any exercise the key thing is to feel like youve worked hard but not to the point that you are in extreme physical discomfort or pain says barrett you do need to push yourself harder in order to progress but it should be effort that is just within the realms of your ability always listen to your body
2551 many people with chronic health problems resign themselves to lives of modest activity or no activity at all thinking vigorous exercise is unsafe or that they lack the stamina for it but recent studies are proving just the opposite
2551 they are showing that high-intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease diabetes stroke pulmonary disease arthritis and parkinsons disease
2551 the studies strongly suggest that a more demanding but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise known as high-intensity interval training or hiit is not only safe for most patients but more effective at preventing or reversing the deficits associated with many chronic ailments
2551 although once reserved for athletes seeking a competitive advantage and for healthy people wanting to burn more body fat hiit is now being studied as a treatment that is sometimes as effective as medication for many people with chronic health problems
2551 researchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods interspersed with periods of rest is more effective than continuous moderate activity at improving cardiovascular respiratory metabolic and mechanical functions
2551 instead of continuous movement for <number> or more minutes as is typical for exercise walkers joggers and cyclists hiit usually involves <number> to <number> seconds of exercise near the peak of a persons ability followed by a comparable recovery period of easy activity with the sequence repeated for a total of about <number> minutes three times a week
2551 we know that exercise is good for people at risk of chronic disease but people tend not to exercise said jonathan p little a specialist in exercise physiology at the university of british columbia at okanagan yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise making it more likely that people will continue it on their own
2551 various activities can be adapted to interval training including cycling swimming walking and jogging especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill but hiit is possible indoors and out for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise
2551 the intensity is tailored to an individuals starting ability the high-intensity component is set at <number> to <number> percent of the persons maximum aerobic capacity dr little said researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically
2552 president trump has told multiple people including epa head scott pruitt that he intends to pull the us out of the landmark paris agreement on climate change according to a new axios report based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations earlier saturday trump announced on twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week over the past three days european leaders and even pope francis have lobbied trump to support the agreement but while leaders from the six other nations in the g<number> signed a statement reaffirming their commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions on saturday trump abstained the entire discussion about climate was very difficult if not to say very unsatisfying announced german chancellor angela merkel clearly frustrated with trumps indecision during the talks
2552 axios adds that its possible trump will impulsively change his mind as trump has done after telling people he would do something in the past axios also points out that all of trumps options for withdrawing from the deal would require as much as a year to carry through on allowing for some additional uncertainty
2552 speaking of uncertainty in a face the nation interview set to air on cbs sunday secretary of defense jim mattis said that he was quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord speaking with the new york times trumps chief economic adviser gary cohn also made it sound as if trump was still making up his mind after a lot of give-and-take between the different countries at the g<number> summit but according to axioss sources trump has already made his decision to ditch the pact and that would definitely be consistent with his numerous past statements as one of the worlds most notorious deniers of the consensus scientific conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of global climate change he also said during his presidential campaign that he would cancel the deal and has infamously and repeatedly called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the chinese and scientists but trump says a lot of things and has at least a few times also hinted that he understood the threat of climate change
2552 president obama helped negotiate the historic paris agreement in <number> and it was officially ratified by the us and <number> other signatories last year should trump leave the pact the us would be the first country to exit which would also be the second time that america has signed onto a global climate deal under a democratic president only to walk away from the same agreement under a republican predecessor as president george w bush ultimately reneged on the kyoto protocol agreed to by president bill clinton in <number>
2552 americas exit from the paris agreement wouldnt invalidate the accord which still has the support of most of the world including china and is likely to proceed without us participation but the failure of the us to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions being the worlds second-highest producer of such pollution will worsen and likely accelerate an already dangerous problem if other countries follow the us out of the agreement which remains a risk that danger only multiplies
2553 president trump has privately told multiple people including epa administrator scott pruitt that he plans to leave the paris agreement on climate change according to three sources with direct knowledge
2553 publicly trump 's position is that he has not made up his mind and when we asked the white house about these private comments director of strategic communications hope hicks said i think his tweet was clear he will make a decision this week
2553 why this matters pulling out of paris is the biggest thing trump could to do unravel obama 's climate policies it also sends a stark and combative signal to the rest of the world that working with other nations on climate change is n't a priority to the trump administration and pulling out threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal given how integral former president obama was in making it come together in the first place
2553 caveat although trump made it clear during the campaign and in multiple conversations before his overseas trip that he favored withdrawal he has been known to abruptly change his mind and often floats notions to gauge the reaction of friends and aides on the trip he spent many hours with ivanka trump and jared kushner powerful advisers who back the deal
2553 behind-the-scenes the mood inside the epa this week has been one of nervous optimism in a senior staff meeting earlier this week pruitt told aides he wanted them to pump the brakes on publicly lobbying for withdrawal from paris
2553 instead the epa staff are quietly working with outside supporters to place op eds favoring withdrawal from paris the white house has told pruitt to lay off doing tv appearances until trump announces his decision on paris in past weeks the epa administrator has gone on tv to say the us needs to quit paris but pruitt told aides he 'll be keeping a lower profile he does n't want a paris withdrawal to be seen as his victory it needs to be the president 's victory one source said paraphrasing what pruitt has told aides pruitt 's aides have told associates in recent days that they remain confident the president will withdraw from paris but they ve been worried about him being overseas and exposed to pressure from european leaders and the environmentalist views of his top aides like ivanka and economic adviser gary cohn top epa staff were relieved when trump refused to join the other six nations of the g<number> in reaffirming strong commitment to the paris agreement one level deeper if trump follows through and announces publicly he plans to withdraw from the paris deal an administration official laid out three ways he could do that
2553 trump could announce he is pulling the us from the deal which would trigger a withdrawal process that would n't conclude until november <number> at the earliest under the deal 's terms any country ca n't send notice of its intent to withdraw until three years after the deal entered into force which was nov <number> <number> the actual process of withdrawal would then take one year in this time it 's feasible trump could change his mind the administration source said trump could declare that the paris deal is actually a legal treaty that requires senate approval such a vote would fail and then trump would have senate backing to not abide by the deal which he deems a treaty a letter that <number> senate republicans including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell sent to trump this week urging him to withdraw from the deal increases the odds of this happening the source said trump could also call for a senate vote in combination with either the first or third option trump could withdraw the us from the treaty that underpins the paris deal which is called the united nations framework convention on climate change this would be the most extreme option because it would take the us out of all global climate diplomacy this process would take just one year will we always have paris all of these scenarios take more time and maneuvering than a simple announcement which ensures the debate about what to do with the climate deal wo n't be over with any time soon
2554 donald trumps intentions regarding us participation in the paris climate deal remained unknown on sunday as one report cited confidants saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was quite certain the president is wide open on this issue
2554 trump said in a tweet on saturday i will make my final decision on the paris accord next week
2554 the message was published as trump left sicily after the g<number> summit leaders of the other g<number> nations germany france britain italy canada and japan issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal which was reached with contributions from barack obama in <number> and signed the following year
2554 a report from the axios news outlet however cited three sources with direct knowledge as saying trump had told confidants including the head of the us environmental protection agency scott pruitt that he plannned to pull the us out of the deal
2554 in an interview broadcast on cbss face the nation meanwhile defense secretary james mattis said the white house had obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard
2554 he added and i was sitting in on some of the discussions in brussels by the way where climate change came up and the president was open he was curious about why others were in the position they were in and im quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord
2554 mattis said that as defense secretary such negotiations were not inside my portfolio but added obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the department of defense and to us thats just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment
2554 the white house did not immediately respond to media requests for comment on sunday morning however the president offered comment of his own via twitter that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the axios report
2554 it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the white house are fabricated lies made up by the hashtagzz media the president wrote whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media and they dont mention names it is very possible that those sources dont exsist sic but are made up by fake news writers hashtagzz is the enemy

2556 president donald trump has reportedly told multiple people in private that he will withdraw the us from the paris climate agreement
2556 though trump has publicly said he has not yet made up his mind axios reports he has privately told several people of his decision including epa administrator scott pruitt
2556 the outlet spoke with three sources who confirmed the information though trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute
2556 trump tweeted saturday morning to say he would announce his final decision  on whether or not the us will stay in the paris agreement next week despite coming under intense pressure from world leaders at the g<number> in sicily
2556 i will make my final decision on the paris accord next week  he wrote
2556 the president earlier declined to comment about the accord as he refused to give into intense international pressure
2556 within the environmental protection agency staffers are quieting down on public lobbying and pruitt will have fewer television appearances about the issue so that the withdrawal will be the president 's victory  according to axios
2556 there are also concerns within the epa that trump could be influenced by the pressures he received overseas according to the outlet earlier saturday the other members of the g<number> voted to abide by the paris climate agreement according to a person familiar with the talks the person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before the formal announcement
2556 the leaders attempted to convince trump for three days  first in brussels at meetings of nato and the european union then in sicily for g<number> but the former reality television host left italy without making clear where he stands
2540 is your breakfast omelet harming your heart a recent study by researchers at western university in canada found that the more egg yolks people ate the thicker their artery walls became an indicator of heart disease risk and that the effect was almost as bad as from smoking cigarettes
2540 in the study the researchers measured carotid plaque build-up in the arteries of <number> men and women average age <number> who were seeking care at cardiovascular-health clinics participants filled out questionnaires detailing lifestyle habits including medication use cigarette smoking and egg-yolk consumption the researchers gauged how much people smoked and how many egg yolks they ate over time by calculating their pack-years the number of packs of cigarettes people smoked per day multiplied by the number of years they spent smoking and egg-yolk years how many egg yolks they ate per week for how many years
2540 after about age <number> participants plaque began building up steadily but among the participants who ate the most eggs three or more yolks per week that build-up increased exponentially the study found as peoples egg-yolk years went up so did their plaque accumulation an association that was independent of factors like gender cholesterol levels blood pressure smoking body mass index and diabetes
2540 more good news kids cholesterol levels are down
2540 among the <number> of participants who ate the most eggs the carotid plaque build-up was about two-thirds that of the studys heaviest smokers the researchers concluded that the plaque increase from eating eggs follows a similar pattern to that of cigarette smoking
2540 arterial accumulation of plaque is a key risk factor for heart attack and stroke as plaque builds up it thickens artery walls and narrows the space through which blood can flow forcing the heart to pump harder if plaques become unstable they can break off and form clots which can halt blood flow to either the brain or the heart causing stroke or heart attack
2540 the authors argue that their findings should quell doubts over the link between high dietary cholesterol and heart disease the prevailing tendency to ignore dietary cholesterol as a risk factor for coronary heart disease requires reassessment including the consumption of cholesterol from eggs the authors wrote
2540 the governments dietary guidelines recommend that adults consume no more than <number> mg of cholesterol a day one whole egg contains about <number> mg of cholesterol nearly two-thirds of your daily recommended ma
2540 the mantra eggs can be part of a healthy diet for healthy people has confused the issue it has been known for a long time that a high cholesterol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular events and egg yolks have a very high cholesterol content study author dr david spence a professor of neurology at westerns schulich school of medicine dentistry said in a statement in diabetics an egg a day increases coronary risk by two to five-fold
2558 a proposed secret communications back channel between donald trump 's team and the kremlin was reportedly intended to allow sensitive discussions about strategy in syria it was reported last night
2558 jared kushner mr trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with sergey kislyak the russian ambassador at trump tower in december
2558 the back channel was intended to connect michael flynn who was at the meeting and later became mr trump 's first national security adviser with russian military leaders the associated press reported it came as the nascent trump administration was developing its syria policy before his inauguration the communications would have used russian diplomatic facilities and bypassed the us intelligence services
2558 such a system was never established and after rex tillerson became secretary of state the idea was reportedly dropped as mr trump 's team decided to communicate with moscow through more official channels
2558 the discussion of a back channel involving mr kushner was first revealed by the washington post late on friday us officials reportedly learned about it by monitoring russian communications mr kislyak was said to have been taken aback by mr kushner 's proposal
2558 it also emerged mr kushner had at least three interactions including two phone calls with mr kislyak during and after the election that had not been previously disclosed the discussions reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and improving us-russian economic relations
2558 mr kushner 's lawyer jamie gorelick said mr kushner previously volunteered to share with congress what he knows about these meetings he will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry
2558 she said mr kushner could not remember any calls with mr kislyak before the election she added mr kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period
2558 according to reuters mr kushner also met sergei nikolaevich gorkov the head of russian state-owned bank vnesheconombank and a trained intelligence officer appointed by vladimir purin at trump tower in december the bank is under us sanctions
2559 jared kushner and russias ambassador to washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between trumps transition team and the kremlin using russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring according to us officials briefed on intelligence reports
2559 ambassador sergey kislyak reported to his superiors in moscow that kushner son-in-law and confidant to then-president-elect trump made the proposal during a meeting on dec <number> or <number> at trump tower according to intercepts of russian communications that were reviewed by us officials kislyak said kushner suggested using russian diplomatic facilities in the united states for the communications
2559 the meeting also was attended by michael flynn trumps first national security adviser
2559 the white house disclosed the meeting only in march playing down its significance but people familiar with the matter say the fbi now considers the encounter as well as another meeting kushner had with a russian banker to be of investigative interest
2559 kislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an american to use russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate a proposal that would have carried security risks for moscow as well as the trump team
2559 neither the meeting nor the communications of americans involved were under us surveillance officials said
2559 the white house declined to comment robert kelner a lawyer for flynn declined to comment the russian embassy did not respond to requests for comment
2559 russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among us analysts but officials said that its unclear what kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with kushner to moscow particularly at a time when the kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with trump
2559 kushners apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with moscow rather than relying on us government systems has added to the intrigue surrounding the trump administrations relationship with russia the fbi closely monitors the communications of russian officials in the united states and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities the national security agency monitors the communications of russian officials overseas
2560 at this point it almost feels like the washington post is trolling everyone with the amount of fake news they put out
2560 during the meeting wherein the washington post asserted that jared kushner proposed a secure line between the trump administration and russia it was actually the russians who proposed it a source close to kushner informed fox news
2560 the source alleges that the permanent back channel was never discussed what really happened was the proposal of a one-off call about syria
2560 fox news reports
2560 a december meeting between jared kushner president donald trumps son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the trump administration and russian ambassador sergei kislyak at trump tower focused on syria a source familiar with the matter told fox news monday
2560 during the meeting the russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the trump administration and russia not kushner a source familiar with the matter told fox news that follows a recent report from the washington post alleging that kushner wanted to develop a secure private line with russia
2560 the idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed according to the source instead only a one-off for a call about syria was raised in the conversation
2560 in addition the source told fox news the december meeting focused on russias contention the obama administrations policy on syria was deeply flawed
2561 the idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed according to the source instead only a one-off for a call about syria was raised in the conversation
2561 in addition the source told fox news the december meeting focused on russia 's contention that the obama administration 's policy on syria was deeply flawed
2561 jared kushner wanted secret communications channel with russia new report alleges
2561 details of the meeting follow a nbc report that kushner who is married to trumps daughter ivanka is currently under fbi scrutiny as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia
2561 kushner suggested the use of russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with kislyak from monitoring according to the post
2561 kislyak allegedly then relayed the suggestion to his superiors in moscow that was based on intercepts of russian communications that were reviewed by us officials although neither the meeting nor the communications of the americans involved were under us surveillance officials told the post
2561 the source has told fox news that kushner is eager to tell congress about the meeting and any others of interest
2562 president trump 's son-in-law and now top white house advisor jared kushner proposed a secret back channel between the kremlin and the trump transition team during a december meeting with a leading russian diplomat
2562 kushner spoke with ambassador sergey kislyak about creating that line of communication to facilitate sensitive discussions aimed at exploring the incoming administration 's options with russia as it was developing its syria policy according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke with the associated press
2562 the intent was to connect trump 's then-chief national security advisor michael t flynn with russian military leaders said the source who was n't authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity
2562 russia a pivotal player in syria has backed syrian president bashar assad often at the expense of civilians during a long civil war the white house did not acknowledge the meeting or kushner 's attendance until march at the time a white house official dismissed it as a brief courtesy meeting
2562 kushner 's involvement in the proposed back channel was first reported by the washington post which said he proposed using russian diplomatic facilities for the discussions apparently to make them more difficult to monitor
2562 the newspaper cited anonymous us officials who were briefed on intelligence reports on intercepted russian communications
2562 the post wrote that kislyak was reportedly taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an american to use russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate a proposal that would have carried security risks for moscow as well as the trump team
2562 according to the person familiar with the kushner meeting the trump team eventually felt there was no need for a back channel once rex tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state and decided to communicate with moscow through more official channels tillerson was sworn in feb <number>
2562 flynn served briefly as trump 's national security advisor before being fired in february after officials said he misled vice president mike pence about whether he and the ambassador had discussed us sanctions against russia in a phone call
2563 president trump unexpectedly fired fbi director james comey on tuesday after a finding by the justice department that he mishandled the investigation into hillary clinton 's emails last year
2563 trump said he acted based on the recommendations of attorney general jeff sessions and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein who found that comey improperly moved to usurp the attorney general 's authority and decided not to prosecute clinton
2563 i have received the attached letters from the attorney general and deputy attorney general of the united states recommending your dismissal as the director of the federal bureau of investigation trump said in a letter to comey i have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office effective immediately
2563 while i greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that i am not under investigation i nevertheless concur with the judgment of the department of justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau trump said it is essential that we find new leadership for the fbi that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission i wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors
2563 the trump administration will immediately begin a search for comey 's successor fbi deputy director andrew mccabe has been floated as a possible replacement according to fox news
2563 the fbi is one of our nation 's most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement trump said in a white house statement
2563 in a memo explaining to trump why he thought comey should be fired rosenstein who was sworn into office in late april pointed to the fbi director 's july press conference explaining why democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton should not be prosecuted over her use of a private email server while secretary of state
2563 the director was wrong to usurp the attorney general 's authority on july <number> <number> and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution it is not the function of the director to make such an announcement at most the director should have said the fbi had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors rosenstein wrote
2563 comey 's involvement in the <number> general election did n't end there on oct <number> just days before voters went to the polls comey sent a letter to congress saying new emails had surfaced related to the investigation into whether clinton had mishandled classified information
2564 just hours after the fbi sent a letter tuesday to the senate judiciary committee clarifying his testimony in relation to the hillary clinton email scandal fbi director james comey was fired
2564 today president donald j trump informed fbi director james comey that he has been terminated and removed from office white house press secretary sean spicer said in a statement president trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and attorney general jeff sessions
2564 trump 's letter terminating comey quickly leaked online
2564 while i greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that i am not under investigation i nevertheless concur with the judgment of the department of justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau trump wrote it is essential that we find new leadership for the fbi that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission
2564 here are a few reasons both stated and possible comey may have been canned
2564 he hurt the fbi 's reputation
2564 a memorandum prepared by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein recommending comey 's termination kicks off with the fact that over the past year the fbi 's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage and it has affected the entire department of justice
2564 he mishandled the clinton email investigation
2564 rosenstein writes that comey should not have given a news conference last july recommending that clinton who used a private email server while secretary of state not face criminal charges the deputy attorney general writes that comey should have turned his findings over to federal prosecutors he also takes issue with comey 's decision to send a letter just days before the november election revealing newly discovered clinton emails when federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation we are not concealing anything we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information the letter states
517 three afghanistan national army officers taken into custody after going missing during a training exercise
517 three afghan national army soldiers who did not return to a training exercise at us military base in massachusetts were found trying to cross the canadian border local media reported on monday
517 the men were taken into custody at a border crossing near niagara falls new york wcvb-tv reported citing an unidentified law enforcement source
517 military officials did not immediately respond to request for comment and the report could not be independently verified
517 the three soldiers were reported missing from joint base cape cod located in a beach resort area after a saturday trip to a nearby mall and are not viewed as a security threat according to a spokesman for the massachusetts national guard which helps run the facility
517 the men were not armed and had no access to weapons during their training officials said
517 us military officials are trying to find the three soldiers major jan mohammad arash captain mohammad nasir askarzada and captain noorullah aminyar according to a spokeswoman for us central command
517 the men part of a group of <number> soldiers from six nations participating in the exercise were in the country legally and had broken no laws by failing to return to the base the spokeswoman said
2566 with an unanticipated coup de thtre donald trump fired fbi director james comey yesterday may <number> comey learned of his dismissal from cable news reports while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the fbi it was so unexpected that the former fbi director apparently thought it was a joke according to the official version of what transpired the trump administration decided to fire comey in large part because of his handling of the investigation into hillary clintons emails but the fact that comey was in charge of investigating potential ties between the trump administration and russia seems too coincidental to overlook many pundits have also pointed out the parallels between trumps decision and president richard nixons notorious saturday night massacre when nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating the watergate scandal trumps administration has already weathered its fair share of scandals the maelstrom of media coverage and the confusing and contradictory explanations offered by trump aides can make it difficult to discern which stories are actually problematic and which are more smoke than fire so how big a deal is comeys firing to gauge this we first need to know the real reasons motivating trump and his attorney general with the administration sticking to its storyfor nowhere is a ranking of possible scenarios trump fired comey because his mistakes made the fbi look bad
2566 ranking easy d on may <number> comey testified in front of the senate judiciary committee during this appearance he said that hillaryclintons top aide huma habedin had forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails to her husband anthony weiner some of which were classifiedso that weiner could print them out that claim turned out to be incorrect according to the white house it was also the last straw comey had mishandled the clinton investigation since the very beginning the administration used this last mistake as a reason to finally pull the plug on him if plain incompetence is indeed the real reason behind comeys firing it would represent the least concerning scenario as quartz has already pointed out the decision could have been managed more elegantly and the timing is bizarre as most of comeys alleged mistakes happened months ago then again delayed firings are one of trumps specialities the silver lining if trump is truly committed to investigating russias alleged meddlingand this is a huge hypothetical ifhe may be more likely to appoint an independent special prosecutor to pick up comeys investigation trump fired comey because he wouldnt investigate wiretapping at trump tower
2566 ranking sad trump is a master conspiracy theorist especially when it comes to the circumstances of his own election whether claiming clinton benefited from millions of illegal votes or arguing with the national parks service over the crowd at his inauguration trump by his own admission believes the truth is not absolute one of trumps strongly held opinions is the unproven claim that president obama tapped his phones during the campaign relatedly its possible that when comey refused to substantiate the conspiracy the president grew increasingly frustrated and eventually decided to cook up an excuse to get rid of the fbi director comeys bungled testimony regarding the clinton emails represented the perfect opportunity a vindictive president who believes in alternative facts and doesnt like being questioned is an unpredictable president partisanship is bad enoughpresidents should not allow their personal biases to dictate policy and professional duties trump fired comey because of the russia investigation
2566 ranking total disaster but what if trump was truly attempting to use his executive powers to halt an investigation and potentially enable a cover-up this is the worst case scenario comey was reportedly expanding the investigation into russias alleged involvement in the <number> presidential election in this last and most troubling scenario trump eager to hinder the fbis searchor simply wishing to avoid a prolonged pr disasterinstructed his staff to find an excuse no matter how old to cut the head off the proverbial snake attorney general jeff sessions who had publicly recused himself from the russia investigation was involved in the decision of removing comey and will be involved in choosing the next fbi director if impeding the fbis investigation really was the objective trump will now be able to select a prosecutor friendly to the white house whoever is selected will also have their predecessors fate as a reminder of what happens to directors who dare challenge the president in such a scenario it is also unlikely the attorney general who helped him get rid of comey would appoint a special prosecutor

2568 as genetically modified gm foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding gm food safety these concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented animal toxicity studies with certain gm foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems the review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each gm food but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings the results of most studies with gm foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic pancreatic renal or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological biochemical and immunologic parameters however many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment the use of recombinant gh or its expression in animals should be re-examined since it has been shown that it increases igf-<number> which may promote cancer
2569 you do n't have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves more than <number> percent of the corn and soy grown in the united states comes from seeds whose dna has been rejiggered to increase yields and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods from soda to salad dressing to bread advocates say genetically modified gm foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicalswhich means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all but the question remains what impact do gm foods have on our health
2569 the answer is no one really knows gm foods have been on the market only since <number> and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce to date most of the studies have been done on animals worryingly though some of those studies link gm foods to altered metabolism inflammation kidney and liver malfunction and reduced fertility in one experiment multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of gm soy by the third generation they were losing the ability to produce offspring producing about half as many pups as the non-gm soy group
2569 in addition allergy sufferers worry that as genes are transferred between plants allergenic proteins from say peanuts or wheat will pop up in unexpected places like soy or sugar richard goodman phd a professor of food science and technology at the university of nebraska-lincoln and a former scientist for monsanto says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening but inserting new genes into a seed 's delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists ca n't predict all the consequences there is for example the possibility of creating brand-new allergens
2569 despite the potential health implications more gm foods appear each year in <number> the usda approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets sucrose and alfalfa hay for livestock the fda is expected to okay a fast-growing salmon in the near future and possibly on the horizon pigs designed to produce omega-<number>s
2569 yet because gm foods are not required to be labeled as such it 's impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods gary hirshberg chairman and cofounder of stonyfield the organic yogurt company thinks that 's not right last october he partnered with just label it a national coalition of nearly <number> organizations that 's currently petitioning the fda to give consumers a choice more than <number> people have already signed to add your name go to justlabelitorg
2569 the status quo is innocent until proven guilty says ashley koff a registered dietitian who studies gm foods as it was for trans fats ddt and countless other harmful chemicals a labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe to protect their sales nearly <number> other countriesincluding china brazil and most european nationshave mandated that genetically modified organisms gmos be marked and in an msnbc online poll <number> percent of more than <number> respondents said that they should be labeled at press time <number> states had introduced legislation to promote gmo labeling
2569 hirshberg for one remains impatient i 'm <number> he says i do n't want to wait another <number> years to see what the science says at this point i want to decide for myself
2570 over the past few years a number of countries have completely banned gmos and the pesticides that go along with them and they are doing so for a reason the latest country to consider a complete ban is russia after top government scientists recommended at least a <number> year ban
2570 the truth is we dont know enough about gmos to deem them safe for human consumption believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago there is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless
2570 there are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why gmos should not be consumed and more are emerging every year there are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them
2570 by slipping it into our food without our knowledge without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food we are now unwittingly part of a massive experimentthe fda has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food so theyll be treated in the same way the problem is this geneticists follow the inheritance of genes what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species now david suzuki doesnt normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints its very very bad science we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally theres absolutely no reason to make that conclusion geneticist david suzuki
2570 if anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that gmos are totally safe to eat they havent done their research there is no reason gm foods should be approved safe for consumption we just dont know enough about them we could easily feed the planet through organic gmo free methods there is absolutely no reason we need gm foods around
2570 below ive presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research if youre interested
2570 <number> multiple toxins from gmos detected in maternal and fetal blood
2570 research from canada the first of its kind has successfully identified the presence of pesticides -associated with genetically modified foods in maternal fetal and non-pregnant womens blood they also found the presence of monsantos bt toxin the study was published in the journal reproductive toxicology in <number> you can read the full study here
2570 given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus more studies are needed particularly those using the placental transfer approach thus our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition toxicology and reproduction in women today obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known thus knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area <number>
2571 activists often cite the alleged potential health risks of genetically modified foods one recent example of this<number> scientific studies proving gmos can be harmful to human health posted on collective-evolutioncomoutlines many familiar concerns and points in each case to credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why gmos should not be consumed
2571 are these concerns credible what do the studies cited actually claim
2571 <number> multiple toxins from gmos detected in maternal and fetal blood
2571 the blog post sites a <number> study that alleges to show this danger the authors identified the bt protein cry<number>ab in maternal and fetal blood a protein found in some gmos but also commonly used as a pesticide in organic farming the paper is flawed the researchers measurements were based on an experimentassay designed to detect bts cry<number>ab in plants not in humans as this post in biofortifiedorg explains the pregnant women in the study would have had to eat several kilos of corn in order to get the bt measurements that were detected in their blood
2571 additionally theres the so what factor humans lack the receptors for the protein so it has no impact on us did you know that chocolate is toxic to dogs are you concerned that it might be toxic to you probably not if you are concerned then youve missed out on the greatest source of joy known to human taste buds some chemical compounds behave differently among species and both bts cry<number>ab and chocolate are examples of this
2571 <number> dna from genetically modified crops can be transferred into humans who eat them
2571 thats not what the cited <number> study concluded the authors found that whole genes from our food can be detected in our plasma that does not mean that theyve integrated into our dna it means that theyve been found floating in the space between cells and thats any food not just gmos dna from gmos behave no differently than dna from organic or conventional foods
2571 if you arent concerned about the dna from blueberries transferring into you then you should not be concerned about dna from gmos either the papers deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments several recent papers see here and here have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little dna to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents for a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing see here
2571 <number> new study links gmos to gluten disorders that affect <number> million americans
2572 its been several months since the intelligence community concluded russia tampered in the election including stealing democratic party emails and giving them to wikileaks
2572 yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists that wikileaks actually got the emails from a democratic national committee staffer who was shot and killed in july <number>
2572 seth rich who worked on voter access projects for the dnc was <number> when he was killed early in the morning near his washington home ten months later the case remains unsolved though washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery
2572 wikileaks published tens of thousands of internal dnc emails several days after rich died leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related wikileaks offered a <number> reward for information about richs murder
2572 the story is back in the news because on may <number> a private investigator looking into richs case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right
2572 but the investigator a man named rod wheeler backtracked on his claims the next day and the rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter saying their son was not wikileaks source
2572 even so some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy most prominently on fox news among them are host sean hannity and former republican house speaker newt gingrich
2572 we have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the democratic national committee who apparently was assassinated at <number> in the morning having given wikileaks something like <number> emails and <number> attachments gingrich said on fox may <number> nobodys investigating that and what does that tell you about what was going on because it turns out it wasnt the russians
2572 contrary to gingrichs statement the thin case that rich was the dnc leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that russia was the culprit two days after gingrich made this claim fox news retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory
525 the hackers behind a devastating cyberattack at sony pictures have sent a new message to executives at the company crediting them for a very wise decision to cancel the christmas day release of the interview a source close to the company told cnn the email message was received by sony 's top executives on thursday night and was obtained by cnn
525 the source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way a sony spokesman declined to comment the hacker message is effectively a victory lap telling the studio now we want you never let the movie released distributed or leaked in any form of for instance dvd or piracy the message also says and we want everything related to the movie including its trailers as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately it warns the studio executives that we still have your private and sensitive data and claims that they will ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble the email was titled message from gop the anonymous hackers have called themselves guardians of peace sony is still reeling from the late november cyberattack that crippled its computer systems and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the christmas release of the interview seth rogen and james franco 's comedy about an attempted assassination of north korean leader kim jong-un us officials now believe north korea instigated the hack lending credence to the sony executives who privately started calling it a terrorist act weeks ago since the cancellation on wednesday the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop thursday night 's message implied that the leaks will stop in a statement on wednesday when the film 's release was scrapped the company said we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome
2574 my investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between seth rich and wikileaks  rod wheeler former dc homicide investigator
2574 wheeler made his comments on the possible rich-wikileaks connection in a story first reported monday night by fox <number> dc
2574 in an appearance on fox news  hannity tuesday night wheeler said a federal investigator that was involved on the inside of the case saw rich 's computer and the case file
2574 wheeler told host sean hannity the investigator came across as very credible when you look at that with the totality of everything else that i found in this case its very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think well perhaps there were some email communication between seth and wikileaks 
2574 but a spokesman for rich 's family on tuesday said wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions seth rich sent emails to wikileaks unsubstantiated brad bauman said even if purported emails were to surface it would not necessarily mean rich had helped wikileaks
2574 even if tomorrow an email was found it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so bauman said we are a family who is committed to facts not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seth 's murderers
2574 although bauman said wheeler was paid by a third party the family is named as clients of wheeler 's capitol investigations on a contract signed by rich 's father joel rich
2574 the family has been sensitive to speculation that rich could have leaked emails damaging to the dnc since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims
2574 an fbi forensic report of rich 's computer  generated within <number> hours after rich 's murder  showed he made contact with wikileaks through gavin macfadyen a now-deceased american investigative reporter documentary filmmaker and director of wikileaks who was living in london at the time the federal source told fox news
2575 the life of seth rich a <number>-year-old democratic national committee staffer ended nearly a year ago when he was shot to death near his house in washington dc then came the tragic and bizarre afterlife since july rich has been the focus of intense right-wing conspiracy theories that have only escalated as the trump administrations scandals have deepened
2575 as the police have repeatedly stated there is no evidence that richs death was anything other than the consequence of a botched robbery but some people especially on the right believe rich was murdered by the clintons for knowing too much about something the most recent theories claim that rich not the russians was responsible for leaking the emails published in wikileaks that revealed democratic party leaders had talked disparagingly about bernie sanders
2575 thanks to an erroneous fox news story last week which was finally retracted on tuesday rich recently became the focus of an intense media blitz from conservative outlets many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around donald trump
2575 fox newss sean hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to rich even after fox news retracted its story hannity promised he would continue to investigate i retracted nothing he said defiantly on his radio show tuesday
2575 richs family has been begging right-wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control
2575 in death rich has become a martyr to the right buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives there is wikileaks founder julian assange who wants to downplay the connections between wikileaks and the russians there are the clinton haters who want to spread the idea that the clintons are murderers there are the trump supporters who want to minimize the idea that russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate and there are the talking heads on fox news who last week needed something other than negative trump stories to make conversation about
2575 we might not know who killed seth rich but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from how it spreads and the victims it creates
2575 seth rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence seth rich worked in democratic politics for most of his career he grew up and went to college in omaha nebraska where as a student he volunteered on two democratic senate campaigns after graduating he moved to washington dc for a job at greenberg quinlan rosner a progressive opinion research and consulting firm he was later hired by the democratic national committee where he worked on a project to help people find where to vote
2575 on sunday july <number> rich was shot to death about a block from where he lived in the bloomingdale neighborhood of dc gunshot detection microphones place the time of the shooting at around <number> am rich had last been seen at around <number> am leaving lous city bar in columbia heights about a <number>-minute walk from where he lived
528 shocking new details have emerged surrounding joan rivers  clinic visit which led to her ultimately fatal hospitalization according to cnn a source close to death investigators revealed that the late comedienne went into cardiac arrest while her personal doctor was performing a biopsy on her vocal chords without her consent on aug <number> photos joan rivers remembered cnn reports that a staff member at new york city 's yorkville endoscopy told investigators the doctor also took a selfie in the procedure room with rivers while she was under anesthesia photos more celebs we lost this year rivers who passed away a week following her emergency hospitalization on sept <number> was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy performed by gastroenterologist dr lawrence cohen after cohen assessed the fashion police host 's throat to help diagnose her hoarse voice rivers  personal doctor who according to cnn 's source is not a throat specialist or certified to perform biopsies at the clinic then performed a biopsy on her vocal chords without her consent photos joan rivers  life and career investigators believe that rivers  vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy cutting off her oxygen flow and leading to cardiac arrest last week yorkville endoscopy issued a statement denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic in the statement the clinic did n't mention rivers  name due to confidentiality rules a day after the denial was issued the clinic also stated that dr cohen had resigned from his position as medical director
2577 the basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple
2577 the story began nearly <number> years ago when irish physicist john tyndall discovered carbonic acid today known as carbon dioxide was one of a number of perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours to absorb radiant heat
2577 he also realised just how important this was to life on earth as without such gases it would be held fast in the iron grip of frost
2577 about <number> years later the swedish scientist svante arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up particularly in the arctic but the idea remained mostly an academic question until as he predicted the mercury started to rise
2577 this is one of the certainties in climate science the world has got warmer
2577 how do we know that the world has really warmed up
2577 last year the hottest on record for the third year in a row was about <number> degrees celsius above the pre-industrial level according to nasa and the met office boosted slightly by the natural el nino effect svalbard in the arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering <number>c compared to the average between <number> and <number>
2577 in addition to thermometer records going back to the <number>s there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows sea levels rising by <number>cm islands disappearing animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier
2577 ironically the famously impassable northwest passage which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to china is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming
2578 with hurricane matthew wreaking havoc the left is predictably seizing the storm as a means of promoting their radical global warming agenda climate change has not been a major theme this election cycle but hillary clinton is now trying to turn it into one with the help of global warming guru al gore unfortunately for the climate change alarmists despite all the celebrity endorsements and high-minded rhetoric the facts keep getting in the way here are nine things you need to know about the climate change hoax
2578 <number> the climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated in <number> the public discovered emails from the university of east anglia 's climatic research unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide
2578 one of these scientists included dr james hansen a former nasa climatologist who is known by some as the father or grandfather of the climate change myth as it was his model zero that first introduced the concept of global warming hansen philip jones michael mann et al were all involved in trying to lower past temperatures and to adjust  recent temperatures upwards in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming according to the leaked emails the emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the background data on which their findings and temperature records were based even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data they would engage in efforts to smear any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics  work
2578 <number> the climategate scandal was given new life in <number> with the release of new emails the new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of <number> here are a couple of egregious emails from jones found via forbes
2578 ive been told that ipcc is above national foi freedom of information acts one way to cover yourself and all those working in ar<number> would be to delete all emails at the end of the process writes phil jones a scientist working with the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in a newly released email
2578 any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get and has to be well hidden jones writes in another newly released email ive discussed this with the main funder us dept of energy in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data
2578 an email written by mann showed that he tried to get an investigative journalist to investigate and expose a climate skeptic scientist named steven mcintyre
2578 <number> nasa may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change the washington times reported in <number> under pressure in <number> nasa recalculated its data and found that <number> not <number> was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous <number> states nasa later changed that data again and now <number> and <number> are tied for first with <number> slightly cooler
2578 since this occurred at around the same time as the climategate scandal chris horner of the competitive enterprise institute filed a lawsuit to get nasa to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from nasa that revealed a disturbing fact the agency admitted that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the university of east anglia 's climatic research unit reported fox news in <number> meaning nasa climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets
2579 one of the main lines of evidence used by the obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesnt exist in the real world according to a new report by climate researchers
2579 researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites weather balloons weather stations and buoys and found the so-called tropical hotspot relied upon by the epa to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant simply does not exist in the real world
2579 they found that once el ninos are taken into account there is no record setting warming to be concerned about
2579 these analysis results would appear to leave very very little doubt but that epas claim of a tropical hot spot ths caused by rising atmospheric co<number> levels simply does not exist in the real world reads the report by economist james wallace climatologist john christy and meteorologist joseph daleo
2579 also critically important even on an all-other-things-equal basis this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric co<number> concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the <number> critically important temperature time series analyzed they wrote
2579 when epa released its co<number> endangerment finding in <number> it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming the crux of epas argument rested on the existence of a tropical hotspot where global warming would be most apparent that is there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere the fingerprint of global warming
2579 epas endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations including the clean power plan cpp now being fought over in federal court cpp aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions <number> percent by <number> and could cost <number> billion a year according to independent estimates
2579 daleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for el ninos and la ninas what they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for theres no warming trend
2579 el nino is not by any means new daleo told the daily caller news foundation the el ninos and la ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper
2580 climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world a <number> trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer every cent penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding all of it a complete and utter waste
2580 nowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which i sincerely believe and ive been doing a lot of research into this must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world
2580 last year climate change business journal calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is <number> trillion a year
2580 all those carbon traders climate researchers renewables and biofuels experts environment correspondents professors of climate science at the university of east anglia and the potsdam institute sustainability officers on local councils and so on add up the cost of their grants and salaries and <number> trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach
2580 so what does <number> trillion look like in a global economic context
2580 well its roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry
2580 <number> trillion on the global warming industry <number> trillion on the online shopping industry
2580 but theres a key difference between these two industries
2580 one exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want to their mutual benefit the other is a sham
2581 yet more bad news for obamacare this week molina healthcare lost <number> million on the exchanges last year and the ceo told investors there are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond <number>
2581 at first glance its hard to see why this piece of news is worth worrying about unitedhealth recently projected several times those losses and it 's a bigger player on the exchanges why spend so much time looking at one modest-size insurer
2581 because molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed to by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business as one of the bright spots on the exchanges molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people before obamacare they were a sizable player in the medicaid managed care model and it seemed like the expertise theyd thusly acquired was allowing them to design the sort of plans that actually made money on the exchanges which is to say bare bones plans not fancy but adequate apparently thats no longer a money-maker at least for molina
2581 this isnt necessarily the pattern weve seen with other insurers molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool to those who got stuck with the sicker patients those losses were partially offset by lower medical costs than they expected which is certainly good news but its not great news lower-than-expected costs can be from the system working well or they can simply come from the fact that you happened to get a healthier insurance pool if the government makes you give the latter gains back and more then youre still not going to be profitable and insurers that arent profitable over the long term arent going to stick around nor can you fix the problem by adjusting the transfer fund those losses are occurring somewhere in the market someone has to pay for the care if you got rid of obamacares risk transfer provisions those insurers would lose more money and exit the market and the patients would end up with some other insurer who would then lose a bunch of money on them unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate the exchanges are not going to stabilize
2581 molinas losses suggest that instead of stabilizing the exchanges are getting worse there is no way to fix obamacare without fixing the pool so that younger healthier people buy insurance
2581 democrats had six years to come up with a way to do that or perhaps i should say a way to do that that could actually get through congress without hordes of angry voters burning their representatives in effigy they failed now republicans are taking their shot and so far at least they dont seem any more on target than democrats were
2581 the life expectancy of the individual market for health insurance is not looking good
2582 congressional republicans evidently hoping that by repeating an untruth theyll convince american voters and perhaps themselves that its a truth on wednesday said the affordable care act has failed
2582 the undistilled version of this view came from house speaker paul ryan r-wis who emerged wednesday from a meeting with vice president-elect mike pence to assert this law has failed americans are struggling the law is failing while we speak things are only getting worse under obamacare the healthcare system has been ruined dismantled under obamacare
2582 every one of those statements is demonstrably untrue how do we know this we know because every measure of healthcare spending access and cost has improved since the passage and implementation of the affordable care act timothy mcbride of washington university in st louis has done the heavy lifting of pulling together the relevant charts and graphs and posting them online in a series of <number> tweets compiled on storify weve culled some of the most important and present them here
2582 we should add first that ryan also pledged once the gop repeals the law to make sure that there is a stable transition to a truly patient-centered system we want every american to have access to quality affordable health coverage
2582 this is nothing but fatuous gobbledygook the gop has had six years to come up with an alternative plan and never has done so its current strategy is to repeal the affordable care act now and then cook up a replacement sometime in the next two three even four years they cant even agree on a time frame what exactly is a patient-centered system anyway
2582 here are the charts courtesy of professor mcbride
2582 first the overall uninsured rate has come sharply down since the advent of obamacare the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell from nearly <number> in <number> to less than <number> according to the centers for disease control and prevention it 's now at a historic low the decline in uninsured rates was especially pronounced among lower-income americans according to the council of economic advisors and other sources
2582 uninsured rates fell by more than <number> percentage points among the poorest americans eligible for medicaid under the affordable care act those earning less than <number> of the federal poverty line although republicans claim that even if the affordable care act brought down the uninsured rate its enrollees had trouble seeing a doctor that isnt true numerous studies debunk claims that doctors shun affordable care act enrollees this sample by the council of economic advisors shows that the decline in the uninsured rate is closely associated with a reduction in people who were prevented from seeking and finding medical care because of its cost
2582 hospitals are major beneficiaries of the affordable care act as the department of health and human services and the council of economic advisors report hospitals uncompensated care costs fell sharply in medicaid expansion states as patients treated as indigent in the past are now covered by medicaid their uncompensated care costs fell from an average <number> of operating costs before the affordable care act to less than <number> afterward a decline worth tens of billions of dollars nationwide
535 mittens is a seemingly regular household cat that enjoys being scratched under the chin and chasing string around but there 's one thing about a newfoundland family 's pet that sets it apart mittens is a hermaphrodite
535 colleen clarke-murphy who lives in heart 's desire says her daughter brought mittens home thinking it was a sick stray that had been abandoned by its owner
535 colleen clarke-murphy of heart 's desire nl says she was shocked when her veterinarian told her the cat who followed her daughter home had both male and female genitalia cbc
535 she took the cat to a local veterinarian and after an examination in october got the news that makes mittens unique
535 the cat has both male and female genitalia
535 clarke-murphy said it was the last thing she expected to hear about the newest addition to her family
535 her first response to the vet 's news was did i just hear you right
535 clarke-murphy said she would prefer to have another female cat she already has a male and female cat but she 'll follow the advice of her vet who recommends mittens be assigned a male gender
535 they 're the ones who know what they 're doing i mean i really do n't know i 'd like for it to be a female but it really do n't matter it 's got both parts said clarke-murphy
2584 millions may lose coverage next year if congress does not repeal obamacare thats not what this weeks congressional budget office cbo analysis says but it is reality cbos estimating models seem impervious to reality in the real world the obamacare exchanges are in crisis millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid irs penalties and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements but for cbo obamacare is a sea of tranquility the agency assumes that only <number> million people under the age of <number> will be uninsured this year and next if obamacare is left in place to hit that mark <number> million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last that seems unlikely the national health interview survey nhis estimates that <number> million people under age <number> lacked coverage as of september <number> last year the most recent date for which government survey data are available that represents little improvement over its estimate of <number> million as of december <number> meaning that the number of non-elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year since then the obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode fewer people signed up during the open-enrollment period this year than last due in part to premium hikes that averaged <number> percent other insurance companies didnt bother raising prices they fled the exchanges by january <number> counties were down to their last insurer five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges a rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom not cbo its analysts believe that obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle the number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in <number> according to cbo even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges that improbably happy outcome would change the agency says if congress were to enact its repeal bill in that case cbo warns the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by <number> million that includes <number> million medicaid beneficiaries cbo believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses ditto for <number> million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job-based coverage cbo believes that these <number> million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after congress repeals the tax on the uninsured that number will rise to <number> million next year according to cbo that includes <number> million who will abandon medicaid <number> million who will drop their employer-sponsored coverage and <number> million who will leave the exchanges these <number> million people will not despite what youve read lose coverage for the most part cbo says they will choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties emphasis added the gop bill not only retains existing subsidies and medicaid expansion through <number> it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing obamacare exchanges but that spending according to cbo wont halt the stampede to the obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate cbos illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate dont square with reality the evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured the irs reports that in <number> <number> million paid the penalty <number> million obtained an exemption while <number> million simply ignored it thats <number> million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the governments threat of tax penalties cbos estimates of the effects of the gop bill are deeply flawed lets do the math nhis estimates that <number> million non-elderly were uninsured in <number> the year before obamacare was fully implemented if cbo is to be believed the number of uninsured will increase by <number> million next year joining another <number> million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it that would mean that <number> percent of the uninsured <number> million out of <number> million apparently would want nothing to do with obamacares government-defined and subsidized benefits were congress to repeal the individual mandate if cbo is correct the government will have spent <number> billion between <number> and <number> on subsidies and medicaid expansions only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from <number> million to <number> million it is also possible that cbo is wrong about the individual mandate that seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads arent buried in cbos faulty models some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage-interest deduction with a tax on the homeless but does anyone believe that if a republican congress repealed that tax homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates cbos estimates of the effects of the gop bill are deeply flawed they begin with rosy assumptions about the current law in the face of considerable contrary evidence they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage they appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since <number> are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies despite feckless irs enforcement and they assume that even if congress keeps the tax credits and medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets <number> million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured congress should set policy based on reality not on cbos speculations obamacare exchanges are falling apart medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable the house and senate should act now to stabilize those markets repeal the law including the individual mandate and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care decision-making
2585 come november the grim trudge across the increasingly barren obamacare landscape begins anew illinois consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies some types of plans could cost an average of <number> percent to <number> percent more ditto across the country a first tranche of states approved <number> rates with similarly cardiac-arrest-inducing premium increases
2585 many illinois consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers fled this market unitedhealthcare bolted so did aetna land of lincoln health collapsed mid-year leaving policy holders to scramble for coverage that could cost them plenty in many places across illinois and the nation people will find drastically fewer choices of plans than they did last year
2585 states struggling with obamacare are undermining the law the affordable care act has been criticized since it was passed in <number> its success depended on states supporting their marketplaces and enrolling healthy consumers sept <number> <number> those insurers fled because they did n't want to lose more money on a government-run market that is so far out of whack a market they think likely will never be profitable for them that is n't surprising as we enumerate below
2585 but by diagnosing obamacare all of us can see the mistakes that any repair or replacement can avoid so let 's look at the failings and how they can drive solutions
2585 obamacare failed because it flunked economics <number> and human nature <number> it straitjacketed insurers into providing overly expensive soup-to-nuts policies it was n't flexible enough so that people could buy as much coverage as they wanted and could afford not what the government dictated many healthy people primarily want catastrophic coverage obamacare could n't lure them in could n't persuade them to buy on the chance they 'd get sick
2585 obamacare failed because the penalties for going uncovered are too low when stacked against its skyrocketing premium costs next year the penalty for staying uninsured is <number> per adult or perhaps <number> percent of a family 's taxable household income that 's far less than many americans would pay for coverage
2585 obamacare failed because insurance is based on risk pools that is the lucky subsidize the unlucky the unlucky who have big health problems and big medical bills reap much greater benefits than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors  office but obamacare 's rules hamstring insurers they ca n't exclude people for pre-existing conditions and ca n't charge older customers more than three times as much as the young those are good goals but they skew the market in ways obamacare did n't figure out how to offset result young and healthy consumers pay far more in premiums than their claims probably would justify in order to subsidize the unexpectedly large influx of older sicker customers who require expensive care too many unlucky people too few lucky people that will collapse any insurance scheme
2585 obamacare failed because it allowed americans to sign up after they got sick and needed help paying all those medical bills insurance should be structured so that although you do n't know if you 'll need it you pay for it anyway just in case your alternative is financial doom but if you can game the system and for example buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand
2585 obamacare failed because it has n't tamed us medical costs health care is about supply and demand people who get coverage use it especially if the law mandates free preventive care iron law of economics nothing is free someone pays to pretend otherwise was folly those forces combined to spike the costs of care and thus insurance costs
2586 remember how much republicans wanted to repeal obamacare
2586 the republican majority in the house of representatives has voted more than <number> times to repeal the law conservatives have twice brought challenges to the supreme court a court with powerful voices that often lean in their direction only to be largely rebuffed both times the last government shutdown was driven by republicans who insisted on defunding obamacare not to be confused with what may be the next government shutdown driven by republicans insisting on defunding planned parenthood
2586 some suggest that the calls for repealing obamacare are fading sarah kliff argued that the near-complete absence of obamas health overhaul in last weeks republican presidential debate was remarkable
2586 maybe but dont count on it in gop presidential candidate jeb bushs white paper on how he would get to <number> percent growth through supply-side tax cuts his team of economists stresses that repealing the affordable care act will be an important means of enhancing economic growth front-runner donald trump said just last week that he was going to replace obamacare with donaldcare which would be both absolutely great and really spectacular repealing health-care reform remains a prominent talking point for wisconsin gov scott walker and sen ted cruz both gop presidential candidates
2586 well since we dont know whats in it i cant comment on donaldcare
2586 but i can tell you this about obamacare when it comes to meeting one of its most important goals providing coverage to the uninsured it is working extremely well its posting historical gains on this front and in so doing both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents
2586 the facts of the case are thoroughly drawn out in this new analysis by my colleagues matt broaddus and edwin park bp from the center on budget and policy priorities
2586 as the figure above shows newly released census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from <number> percent to <number> last year
2586 thats the largest single-year drop on record based on data going back to <number>

556 breaking informant paris terror suspect on us watch list met with french president sarkozy in <number>
556 <number>st century wire says
556 as the dust settles from this weeks terror extravaganza in france more loose ends are turning up or being tied up with this latest bizarre bombshell which is already fueling speculation as to the covert nature of the charlie hebdo false flag affair
556 a police commissioner from limoges france helric fredou aged <number> photo below turned up dead from a gun shot to the head on thursday amid the charlie hebdo affair a high-ranking official within the french law enforcement command-and-control structure fredou was also a former deputy director of the regional police service
556 at the time of his death police claim to have not known the reason for his alleged suicide this was reflected in their official statements to the media it is unknown at this time the reasons for his actions however a back story appears to have been inserted simultaneously most likely from the very same police media liaisons who then told the press that fredou was depressed and overworked for any law enforcement officer in france it would seem rather odd that anyone would want to miss the biggest single terror event in the century or history in the making as it were
556 here is a link to the original report in the french media which confirms that commissioner fredou was indeed working on the charlie hebdo case
556 the fredou commissioner like all agents srpj worked yesterday on the case of the massacre at the headquarters of charlie hebdo in particular he was investigating the family of one of the victims he killed himself before completing its report a psychological cell was set up in the police station
556 helric-fredou-<number> editors note it is not yet known to <number>wire exactly how the fatal gun shot occurred but if any other past political and high-profile suicided cases are anything to go by authorities will claim that this victim either shot himself in the back of the head with his non-shooting hand in addition if that were the case there would also be a lack of gun powder burns on the hands according to the autopsy
556 uk-based investigative reporter morris<number> interviews phil in france regarding this new development
2482 <number>-year-old iga jasica of poland began making headlines recently after the rumor got out that she accidentally awoke during brain surgery to enjoy a friendly conversation with the surgical staff about cats though only part of the story is true were sort of thrilled to be able to report that its the part about the mid-brain surgery conversation about cats iga revealed on her facebook page saturday that her temporary consciousness during the procedure was actually all part of the plan
2482 the teen told well wishers that when it came to the publications sharing her story many articles have a lot of mistakes she explains that far from being a shock to her doctors waking me up was deliberate this method is called awake craniatomy it was deliberate and planned
2482 jasica even provided readers with a link to the website of university hospital southampton where the surgery is described in detail an awake craniotomy is an operation performed in the same manner as a conventional craniotomy but with the patient awake during the procedure this is a preferred technique for operations to remove lesions close to or involving eloquent functionally important regions of the brain this allows us to test regions of the brain before they are incised or removed and allows us to test patients function continuously throughout the operation the overall aim is to minimise the risks of such operations it says
2482 despite the fact that her brain was indeed exposed during the waking parts of her surgery neurosurgeon dawid larysz recently assured the daily mirror that jasica would not have been able to see or hear anything despite coming round she didnt feel anything and was never in danger he said
2482 recommended for you webcast the art of growth hacking gaining early traction by doing things that do n't scale jasica herself later commented i cant remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats which i love i missed christmas because of this operation but it is the best present i could have had as i am now feeling great
2482 she stresses on her facebook page that the operation was successful and there was nothing damaged the teen says its important to her that people know that the doctors saved my life and encourages readers to not be influenced by stupid articles
2482 otherwise the <number>-year-old seems to be progressing well in her recovery and is looking forward to healthier days whether or not shes decided to seize the opportunity to regale countless future strangers with bad jokes about being the brains of the operation she has yet to reveal

576 despite being heavy competitors with each other samsung and apple do quite a bit more business with each other than some might realize samsung has long been a supplier of some apple product components for iphones and ipads and back in january they were rumored to be providing apple the s<number> system-in-package chipset for the apple watch that debuts later this year now there are reports stating that through their samsung display arm they may become a future supplier to apple for displays of the apple watch the report also states that lg display will actually be the first provider of the oled displays that the apple watch is said to be using lg display also currently makes displays for the ipad
576 as we stated above this wouldnt be the first time that weve seen apple work alongside its competitors let alone two of its biggest competitors to bring one of its own devices to market apple of course had to get the apple watch displays from somewhere because they dont make their own displays for their products and seeing as how both samsung and lg have already produced more than one smartwatch themselves along with the displays on them should these rumors be true it actually makes a lot of sense currently the apple watch isnt available but it is reportedly going on sale this year in april and for the time being the rumor states that lg will be the sole supplier at first
576 whats more is that samsung is reported to be joining in on the display sales sometime as early as the second half of <number> or very early <number> potentially for the next version of the apple watch although at this point in time samsung and lg have both declined to comment on these rumors stated in the south korean media apple has kept quiet on the matter as well whether or not there is any truth to these rumors seems to be uncertain for now but knowing that apple buys display tech from lg display already the rumors are reasonable enough to be at least plausible and its certainly possible for lg display to make more screens for other apple products

2232 the british accent in the video that depicted the despicable and cowardly murder of an american journalist has raised concerns in the uk about the background of the isis jihadist the washington posts report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have americans thinking twice too
2232 in an interview with the bbc foreign secretary philip hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a british accent and said the video seemed to be genuine
2232 hundreds of britons are believed to have traveled to syria to fight in the countrys civil war including many who have joined the islamic state
2232 were absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of british nationals involved in terrible crimes probably in the commission of atrocities hammond said many of these people may seek at some point to return to the uk and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security
2232 a european intelligence official said the british government was examining the video and the speech of the purported executioner to compare it with former guantanamo bay prisoners and other british residents believed to have joined the islamic state
2232 both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the us military prison at guantanamo bay cuba a similar outfit believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison was worn by nicholas berg an american businessman kidnapped in iraq in <number> whose execution by an islamic state precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online the may <number> berg killing was conducted by abu musab al-zarqawi the leader of tawhid wal-jihad at the beginning of the <number> iraq war which became al-qaeda in iraq aqi at around the time of that beheading us forces killed zarqawi in an american airstrike but aqi survived his death and the anbar awakening if barely to morph into isis when the us pulled out of iraq berg was not the only american beheaded by zarqawi either he also killed owen eugene armstrong later in the same year and both berg and armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered as did james foley
2232 the orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing guantanamo bay but the british seem concerned that theres more than just symbolism now in play with isis the us began releasing british subjects from gitmo during the bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight weve seen plenty of recidivism since then and all to this same end to rejoin the jihad against the west and the nations in this region and to recruit others to do the same
2232 it wont be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former gitmo detainee but it is a bit of a surprise that the uk doesnt keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately after all they have already been identified as threats picked up in the battle zones far from home which is how they ended up in gitmo in the first place the bigger worry for the uk and for the us and other western nations will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous it should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger especially since were now desperately looking for ways to roll back isis perhaps we shouldnt provide them more fighters than they already have

2146 nowadays it seems the world is just littered with crises but one thing we do n't have to worry about is crabzilla
2146 a photo depicting what appears to be a <number>-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in kent england started making the rounds on the internet earlier this week the photo was featured on a local curiosities site called weird whitstable and eventually dubbed crabzilla
2146 quinton winter who runs the site told the daily express that he 'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year it had glazed blank eyes on stalks swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws he said
2146 does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation winter asks on his website
2146 experts say neither
2146 the idea of a giant crabzilla  would be very exciting unfortunately i think this is a hoax dr verity nye ocean and earth science researcher at southampton university told the daily mail i do n't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand but i think it 's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo
2146 spider crabs the largest known to british waters grow to about <number> feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where crabzilla is shown lurking

594 the video showing the beheading of us journalist steven j sotloff appears to be authentic us officials said wednesday as president obama said america would not be intimidated by islamic state militants
594 the us intelligence community has analyzed the recently released video showing us citizen steven sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic said national security council spokeswoman caitlin hayden
594 sotloffs family through a spokesman issued a statement suggesting they believed the footage to be authentic as well the family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately said the spokesman barak barfi
594 it was the second such killing carried out by islamic state militants late last month american journalist james foley was beheaded in a similar videotaped slaying
594 in estonia obama vowed to destroy the islamic state militants and said the united states would not be intimidated by the bloodshed
594 the sotloff video which surfaced online tuesday shows a bound and kneeling sotloff being held at knife-point by a black-clad militant against a desert backdrop similar to the one shown in an earlier video depicting the beheading of foley
594 the gruesome killings and the groups threat to decapitate other captives put new pressure on the obama administration at a time when it is weighing how the united states should respond to an al-qaeda offshoot that is seen as ruthless but that has not carried out plots beyond the region
594 the united states has carried out more than <number> airstrikes against islamic state fighters in iraq over the past month since the group expanded its control of territory there but the administration has avoided direct us military involvement in syria aside from a failed attempt to rescue foley and other captives earlier this year
594 the pentagon and us intelligence agencies have developed lists of possible islamic state targets in syria but obama who has expressed concerns about being drawn into syrias civil war indicated last week that he had not yet approved new strikes we dont have a strategy yet obama said in a remark that was later derided by republican lawmakers and critics

613 defence officials were unable to confirm local media reports that the isis boss was among those hit
613 the us-led coalition against isis has carried out a bomb attack on a convoy of senior militants that may have included the group 's leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
613 american defence officials confirmed that the air strikes on friday night destroyed <number> armoured vehicles near the northern iraqi city of mosul and that the mission had been against what was assessed to be a gathering of isis leaders
613 iraqi state television and two officials also said yesterday that the isis leader had been wounded
613 an interior ministry official and a senior iraqi military official both told the associated press that the strike on saturday had wounded baghdadi but gave no details about how bad his injuries might be following speculation about his death
613 the death of the elusive leader would mark a significant step change in the us-led effort to curtail the islamist extremist group
613 among those reportedly confirmed killed in the strikes was abdul rahman al-athaee also known as abu saja one of al-baghdadi 's key aides and a man who regularly travelled with the militant group 's self-proclaimed caliph or spiritual leader

617 beats music will eventually disappear as a brand according to a new report techcrunch reports that apple plans to eliminate the beats music streaming service which it acquired in may but doesnt say when the report is less clear on what apple plans to do with streaming music once source tells techcrunch that on-demand music could be integrated into itunes another source says apple will make a significant music announcement in the first half of <number>
617 engineers from beats music have already been transferred to other divisions at apple including itunes according to the report as techcrunch notes beats music ceo ian rogers was put in charge of apples ad-supported itunes radio product in august and has been splitting his time between the services since then
617 when apple bought the beats brand for <number> billion apple senior vice president eddy cue called beats music the first music subscription service done right though it mostly mimicked existing services from spotify rdio and others beats music tried to differentiate itself through hand-curated playlists and the involvement of music-industry titans like dr dre and trent reznor but after three months it had only <number> subscribers compared to over <number> million on spotify still cue had positioned beats as a key component of apples music strategy saying that the company wanted to offer on-demand listening along with ad-supported radio and digital downloads all of which suggests that while the beats music brand may be going away on-demand streaming from apple could easily take another form if itunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your mp<number>s and on-demand streaming into a single place the beats music brand going away might not be such a bad thing after all

641 the ship could now pose an important threat to the american public as the ship is believed to be infested with thousands of starving rats possibly carrying the ebola virus many of the witnesses who came across the ship over the last months have indeed reported seeing the rodents feeding off the crews bodies as the ship went by experts fear that these animals could now spread the disease to humans and other animals on the continent creating an uncontrolable ebola pandemic in the united states

641 ships and officers of the us coast guard from the entire east coast have been mobilized in a desperate attempt to find and sink the ship before it reaches america
641 experts and analysts estimate that the ships actual course and speed will bring it to land or be washed ashore in southern florida over the next weeks probably near the densely populated miami area the authorities remain confident however that the ship will be found and sunk before it reaches the coast

665 a federal source told myfoxbostoncom the men were caught at the border on monday the report could not be confirmed
665 earlier pentagon officials who spoke to fox news said they did not feel that the missing soldiers posed a public threat us military officials told the associated press that the men arrived at camp edwards on sept <number> they were last seen during a day off at the cape cod mall in hyannis

668 before apple unveiled the apple watch last september reports indicated the device would come with <number> sensors to track health and fitness data leading some healthcare professionals to find the unveiled apple watch 's health features disappointing in a new report the wall street journal offers a look at the original apple watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems
668 apple began developing the watch about four years ago with a focus on health and fitness its not unusual for apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development but the watch was especially challenging people familiar with the matter said internally the project became known as a black hole sucking in resources one of these people saidthe apple watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram also known as an ekg apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user 's blood however a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product
668 the skin conductivity features did n't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin while results varied depending on how tight an apple watch was worn on users  wrists additionally if apple decided to use the health data to provide health or behavioral advice the cupertino company would have to seek approval from the us food and drug administration and other regulators
668 while these features were dropped for the first version of the apple watch sources tell the wsj that they could appear in future versions of the device echoing a reuters report from september
668 last week apple ceo tim cook said the company 's objective with apple watch is to change the way people live their lives and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do which includes activity monitoring reminding users to stand up after a certain time period and non-verbal communication with friends apple is currently asking developers to have their apple watch apps ready by mid-february with some developers traveling to apple 's cupertino headquarters for help
668 cook has confirmed the apple watch will launch in april the wall street journal reports that apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter with half of those units being the entry apple watch sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel apple watch

680 mohamed alhakim claimed militants are harvesting the organs as a way of financing the extremist groups activities
680 he also told journalists doctors in mosul were executed for refusing to harvest organs the associated press reports
680 mr alhakim said bodies with surgical incisions and missing organs had been discovered in shallow mass graves
680 he was earlier speaking to the un council about the state of affairs in iraq where he also accused isis of crimes of genocide in targeting certain ethnic groups
680 however elijah j magnier al rai 's chief international correspondent said mr alhakims claims should be treated cautiously he told the independent isis does n't have the market in this current global war against it to be engaged in this business organ harvesting this requires contacts that isis is losing
680 an isis fighter was also quick to deny claims made by mr alhakim saying the group would not have time to collect the organs of those they killed
680 he was quoted by mr magnier as saying if these claims were true this would be a general policy for isis that it would not be possible to hide

697 if you ve been anywhere even remotely near a computer today you ve probably heard that argentina 's president recently adopted a young jewish man to stop him from turning into a werewolf and why notit 's internet gold also as it turns out not even remotely true
697 according to the washington post the story of the day is as follows
697 a tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf known as el lobison in argentina after his <number>th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form feeding on the dead and murdering all before it the fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born which started the practice in <number> of argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing while yes seventh sons and daughters in argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter read not the adopted child of the country 's president as the guardian points out jewish werewolf-hood has no part in the tradition which is fairly evident from argentinian president cristina fernndez de kirchner 's tweets depicting the country 's newly announced first jewish godson
697 top translation they brought me a menorah they asked me to light it bottom translation i did n't realize it but their visit coincided with hanukkah
697 but as the guardian points out this nice totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient werewolf-esque myth called the lobizn
697 but somehow the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobiznargentina 's equivalent to the european werewolf according to some versions of the myth the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse
697 evidently the chance meeting of a latin american president with a colorful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism
697 in fact the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children there is an actual century-old tradition in which every seventh child born to an argentinian family is eligible to become the president 's godchilda practice originating from czarist russia the tale of the lobizn on the other hand started amongst argentina 's gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the president 's newly minted godson
697 so sorry to burst your bubble internetno werewolf jewish godsons this time but hey at least it got us talking about this again the guardian
700 this video has been hugely viral for months but its only recently that english speakers have begun to share it
700 some sites are claiming its from a peruvian tv show but its not
700 its actually a mockumentary by the sports brand everlast and this campaign to stop street harassment
700 as such its staged but anyway the video purports to show how some men who whistle and make sexist comments on the streets were tricked by a film team
700 the team played out dressing the abusers mothers differently and disguising them
700 waiting for the men to start catcalling
700 and then giving them hell
700 now it didnt actually happen that said el pas actually claimed that the campaign is based on interviews with men who accidentally harassed female relatives by mistake and the message seems to be getting through the original has had over <number> million views
700 the campaign also features natalia mlaga a celebrated volleyball player and coach
2555 jonathan swain and amy harder at axios reported on sunday morning that president donald trump has told confidants that he has made the decision to pull the united states out of the paris climate accords and will make an announcement soon most likely this coming week this report will certainly produce a major backlash from the anti-fossil fuel lobby in the us and globally which correctly views the commitments made by former president barack obama under this executive agreement as the main driving force for increasingly restrictive regulations of the us fossil fuel industries
2555 but this report if true should surprise no one after the president was the only g<number> leader who refrained from endorsing the paris accords on saturday a move that came after one of his advisers had told the media that mr trump 's views related to paris were evolving this statement was taken by many paris supporters as an indication that the president might be moving towards changing his mind and keeping the us in the agreement after all
2555 such hope by paris supporters has always seemed like a pipe dream though since the obama commitments within the paris accord stand in direct opposition to the commitments made by candidate trump during the <number> campaign as well as the energy policy-related actions taken by president trump since assuming office
2555 during his campaign candidate trump made pledges to pull the us out of two obama-era executive agreements  paris and iran  centerpieces of his daily stump speech at every campaign stop every fundraising event every one of the campaign rallies before audiences of thousands of people donald trump overtly promised to end us involvement in both of those agreements which he regularly referred to as terrible deals made by stupid people indeed this was the overarching theme of his entire campaign  that he is a superior negotiator who would be able to negotiate better deals than these for the country
2555 any expectation that he would now after being pressured by his european peers suddenly decide that paris is a fine deal that the us can now live under seems overly optimistic to say the least it would comparable to sherlock holmes after years of demonizing dr moriarty as the worst villain on the face of the earth suddenly deciding he 's a really cool guy with whom he 'd love to have a few beers
2555 recommended by forbes most popular photos the richest person in every state congratulations to venezuela  goldman sachs bails out the country by buying then there is the reality that as president mr trump has already issued a series of executive orders and signed congressional review act resolutions that either reverse outright or order the epa and department of interior doi to rescind or rewrite a raft of obama-era regulations and executive decisions for which the commitments in the paris accords serve as the main underpinnings
2555 the clean power plan the bureau of land management 's blm venting and flaring regulation epa 's methane regulations and stricter ozone standard higher gas mileage requirements for auto makers the council of environmental quality 's ceq social cost of carbon and methane construct the presidential directive to all agencies to consider climate change implications in all permitting planning and leasing decisions  all of these obama-era actions and more were considered to be key elements of us efforts to meet commitments mr obama made under the paris agreement all of these elements have either been eliminated or are in the process of being re-written under directives issued by president trump

747 in a blog entry on six colors should be noted that in different product images of the apple watch edition  btw the most expensive version with <number>-carat gold  it is to realize that the point on the crown of the digital crowncorresponds to the strap color this raises the question of whether buyers are enabled to color-adjust the crown
747 there are several ways as six colors is mentioning the first would be very interesting but it is extremely unlikely accordingly the crown could have a small lcd screen that when you change the bracelet it displays the corresponding color much more plausible however the idea that when you buy a color the point can be selected which should appear on the crown this would be independent of the bracelet in addition it may possible apple allows a replacement of the crown so that the color can be changed as needed
747 in the end however we can only speculate only at the official launch we 'll be able tohave certainty there are also signs that only at the apple watch edition this may possible other versions will probably have to lifewithout such an option
747 therefore there are still some question marks regarding the apple watch

2179 if you 're an american and you ve been watching the pro-democracy protests in hong kong closely you may have noticed something familiar a number of the young demonstrators are using the same hands up do n't shoot gesture that became a symbol of last month 's protests in faraway ferguson missouri
2179 hong kong 's protesters have good reason to put their hands up police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations which are rallying against the chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in <number> while injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far the clashes have been bad enough that hong kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently and that anxiety is showing in these photos
2179 it 's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to ferguson or borrowing something they 'd seen on the news for their own purposes or using it coincidentally but hong kongers particularly young hong kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use some of the protesters are organized within a group called occupy central named for hong kong 's central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with occupy wall street
2179 it 's fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in america become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world however it got there

792 once thought to be a key component of apple 's acquisition of beats the beats music subscription service and accompanying brand will apparently be shuttered leaving just itunes-related software services according to a new report
792 citing five sources at apple and beats techcrunch reported on monday that although the exact timetable is unknown apple plans to sunset the beats music service and brand people involved in the product are said to have already been moved onto other projects at the company including itunes
792 if true the move would be a change from may when apple emphasized beats music as a key component of its <number> billion purchase of the headphone maker the beats music product received top billing over beats electronics in apple 's press release announcing the deal even though the headphone making side of the business is the brand 's most recognizable role
792 observers also believed that the beats music service allowed apple to enter a key subscription market where the itunes store and itunes radio do not compete sales of digital albums have been declining in recent years as customers have migrated to competing services like spotify and pandora
792 but beats music also got off to a slow start with just <number> subscribers as of march its performance since being acquired by apple remains unknown
792 the rumor would suggest that apple 's <number> billion buyout of beats was really about the headphones side of the business as well as the talent and credibility brought on by the acqui-hires of beats 's jimmy iovine and dr dre
792 iovine is a longtime music industry executive and was a personal friend of late apple co-founder steve jobs both he and dr dre have considerable sway in the industry and could help secure content for apple 's itunes business
792 when it was announced earlier this year apple 's <number> billion buyout of beats proved controversial with critics suggesting that the iphone maker had overpaid for a company better known for its brand than quality products but proponents believe the addition of beats products to apple 's portfolio will help the company earn revenue from a lucrative accessories market where the company did not previously compete
792 update in a statement to recode apple spokesman tom neumayr said the techcrunch rumor is not true but did not offer further comment on the matter the publication cites sources at apple as saying branding for beats music could change in the future though the streaming service itself will remain active

801 in q<number> <number> we expect that apple could very well release at least two new products the apple watch and the <number>-inch macbook air we have heard two separate rumors that the former will be launched in march and the latter will see a general q<number> <number> release but if youre still a little skeptical analyst ming-chi kuo has basically confirmed it kuo has been known for his pretty accurate predictions regarding apples product lineup and their release timeframes so there could be some truth in his claims according to kuo he confirms that apple will indeed be releasing the apple watch in march and the upcoming <number>-inch macbook air later on in the quarter as well but no specific dates were provided according to kuo the apple watch could see some supply constraint this is due to key components of the wearable having low production yields but kuo notes that this is not an issue for the other components which should see high shipments in this quarter he also expects that apple will ship <number> million apple watch units in q<number> <number> alone kuo also predicts that apple will reveal more details about the apple watch ahead of its release and offer up more detailed information about its battery life and when pre-orders will begin which we guess sounds pretty probable however as is the case with all rumors theyre best taken with a grain of salt for now but do check back with us in the coming weeksmonths where hopefully we will have more details for you
802 seems like the president of argentina cristina fernndez kirchner did not exactly save a jewish boy from becoming a werewolf apparently this is what happens when a tradition and an urban legend get intertwined the tradition does dictate that the seventh child born to an argentine family with six consecutive children of the same sex is eligible to become the godchild of the president and the urban myth says this childs fate is unlucky as it is meant to become a werewolf sooner or later so technically lair tawil was safe
802 according to the real legend of the lobizn or werewolf it is only the seventh son of the seventh son who could be potentially cursed the guardian reported argentine historian daniel balmaceda said the local myth of the lobizn is not in any way connected to the custom that began over <number> years ago by which every seventh son or seventh daughter born in argentina becomes godchild to the president
802 the tradition of the president adopting a seventh child began in <number> when then-president jos figueroa alcorta was asked by russian immigrants enrique brost and apolonia holmann to become their sons godfather the couple wanted to maintain a custom from czarist russia where the tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons and argentinas president accepted
802 although isabel pern passed the law in <number> its still so that not every seventh child is eligible to become a presidential godchild the honor is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively with no daughters in between the president with most godsons was juan pern who had <number> over three terms in office kirchner has already become the presidential godmother of almost <number> children since taking office in <number> and for all we know she might ve saved a few from becoming werewolves
806 like most other places with people lima peru has a surplus of men who pass those crucial moments throughout their work day by sexually harassing women in the streets
806 everlast the brand you had no clue was this fierce actually did something about it
806 they filmed men catcalling their own mothers everlast tracked down the mothers of their very scummy spawn and got them on board for a worthwhile mission shame your son by getting him to accidentally catcall you everlast gave these moms makeovers wigs manicures the whole thing then they sent these women out all dressed up like all the other desperate women who wear dresses out in public so that they could be magnets for pervy lines like where are you going can i come
806 predictably this video shows the sons saying dirty stuff to their own mothers in disguise but it doesnt stop there in the typically charming way were all so enchanted with one dude calls his own mom piggy another says tasty panties thats when the most satisfying part happens the mothers turn around for the reveal and bitch these men out so this is one chance encounter with a lady in the street they wont forget the glorious leader of this effort who is wearing fingerless everlast driving gloves wants the moms to slap these scoundrels but watching them freak out is even more gratifying even if it isnt real its required viewing for all men with female relatives
806 it could have been trite to have moms help their sons see the light by subjecting them to street harassment it might have been corny if everlast gave these dudes a chance to redeem themselves but these boss women offered no such opportunity they were on a war path to make their sons pay in one screaming session they express all the anger youve felt every time you had to deal with sex invites in the morning
806 its a pretty genius way to turn the tables on the catcallers at least its definitely more effective than issuing a friendly card explaining why its not polite to express interest in a strangers underwear one of the guys explains to his mommy that it wasnt him saying those nasty things it was the guy in the car iron-clad alibis like this are best handled by a raging mother in heels freud may have already died but now hes literally dying over this

810 a russian fisherman says the only thing that prevented a brown bear from killing him was justin bieberspecifically a ringtone of bieber 's first big hit baby
810 igor vorozhbitsyn <number> had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he 'd marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind
810 there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me he said according to the daily mail
810 the bear mauled vorozhbitsyn 's face and chest inflicting serious cuts and bruises he believes it probably would have killed him if his phone had n't gone off in the nick of time blaring baby loudly enough to drive the bear away

820 a new law in saudi arabia banning tempting eyes has become the latest example of female oppression in the country
820 the law which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil has been branded stupid by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media ainaorg reports
820 sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman of the saudi arabian committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice said they had the right to force women to cover their face
820 the men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes especially the tempting ones he said
820 we have the right to do so
820 many commentators wondered how the word tempting would be applied
820 one unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup
820 or even without makeup if they are beautiful the woman will be in trouble they added
820 prince naif whose impending ascension to the saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression looks likely to be as intolerant as his father king abdullah after suggesting that any muslim should support the committees new law
823 steve jobs was not a man known for idle pleasantries the late apple ceo was infamous for his often brutal email responses to customers when one customer emailed to say that the iphone <number> lost all reception when the users hand is over the antenna jobs coldly responded that they should just avoid holding it that way when another customer complained about apples repair system jobs replied that it sounds like youre just looking for someone to get mad at other than yourself
823 much has been made of the difference in management styles between jobs and his successor tim cook but now another has emerged their approach to customer queries whereas the former exhibited the icy bluntness exhibited above the latter well actually takes it on board
823 in a discussion about customer service on the rapple subreddit redditor lerde recently recounted how he reached out to tim cook via email about the super low quality hold music played while on hold with apple while cook didnt responded personally to my surprise a lady from cupertino called me up the next day telling lerde that cook had indeed received the email had looked into it personally and agreed that something had to be done further tests were promised and lo and behold the next time i called apple the hold music was indeed very pleasant
823 its a result made all the more surprising by the sheer volume of email that cook receives on a daily basis appleinsider reports that the ceo has previously told nbc that he gets hundreds sometimes thousands of emails from customers cook added this is a privilege because they talk to you as if youre sitting at their kitchen table because they care so deeply about apple they want to make a suggestion or want to ask for help on something or want to tell you how much they love the product

823 i once sent tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with apple it was super low quality therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because i was on hold for <number> minutes for something so simple iphone did n't turn on needed to set up a repair as in my country no apple store have to send it to another country
823 much to my surprise a lady from cupertino called me up the next day saying she 'd received a concerning email from tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone that tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done she assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections
823 the next time i called apple the hold music was indeed very pleasant

2539 eggs are the dr jekylll and mr hyde of the breakfast world one day theyre a diet darling chockful of healthy fats vitamin e and protein the next thing you hear eggs are bad for youas bad as cigarettes in fact according to a recent study in the journal atherosclerosis
2539 first heres the deal on that new study researchers from western university in canada examined over <number> men and women to come to the conclusion that regularly eating egg yolks was two-thirds as bad as smoking when it comes to carotid plaque in the arteries a known risk factor for stroke and heart attack
2539 but before you ditch the eggs experts point out that this study doesnt exactly give the whole picture the main crack the research shows an association between egg consumption and plaque buildup rather than a cause-and-effect relationship says cardiologist gordon tomaselli md from the american heart association in other words theres no way to tell which came first the plaque or the egg the study also didnt control for what else participants ate or take into account how much they exercised which can play a big role in heart disease dr tomaselli says
2539 while its interesting that the graphs of egg yolk consumption and smoking take a similar shape when looking at carotid plaque build-up this study doesnt take into account the many other adverse effects of smoking namely high blood pressure and lung cancer says dr tomaselli
2539 and your rise-and-shine scramble has more to it than just cholesterol eggs contain many other nutrients including unsaturated fats which may be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease says gregg fonarow md of ucla cardiology whether the net effect of egg consumption is beneficial neutral or harmful requires assessing more than just measuring the cholesterol content of egg yolk he says
2539 here the bottom line on how to eat eggs healthily
2539 <number> skip the three-egg omelet its safest to limit your egg consumption to one a day the american heart association recommends that most people limit their daily cholesterol intake to <number> milligrams and one yolk contains about <number> milligrams if a single-egg scramble simply wont cut it eat extra whites this way youll get the protein from the whites without the added cholesterol of the yolk says dr tomaselli
2539 <number> hold the bacon one of the biggest oversights of this study is that it didnt account for the other foods in a persons dietand anyone whos ever ordered a grand slam knows that eggs usually come with side dishes that arent exactly good for you says marisa moore rd from the academy of nutrition and dietetics her advice pair your egg with fresh fruit whole grain toast and veggies instead of fennel sausage a greasy hash and bacon
2539 <number> snack smart that cookie youve got your eye on well that has egg in it too you have to be cognizant that other dishes contain eggs and cholesterol says dr tomaselli when your next snack attack rolls around reach for a handful of nuts which are rich in heart-healthy vitamin e monounsaturated fats and fiber check out <number> more high-protein snacks

910 the ring little aiden brought to school may not have been the true ring of power but it had enough controversy to get him suspended from a kermit texas school
910 tolkien lore led a texas boy to suspension after he brought his one ring to school
910 kermit elementary school officials called it a threat when the <number>-year-old boy aiden steward in a playful act of make-believe told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional middle earths mount doom
910 it sounded unbelievable the boys father jason steward told the daily news he insists his son didnt mean anything by it
910 the stewards had just watched the hobbit the battle of five armies days earlier inspiring aidens imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all
910 kids act out movies that they see when i watched superman as a kid i went outside and tried to fly steward said
910 aiden claimed thursday he could put a ring on his friend 's head and make him invisible like bilbo baggins who stole gollums precious in jrr tolkiens fantasy series the lord of the rings
910 i assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friends existence the boy 's father later wrote in an email if he did i 'm sure he 'd bring him right back
910 principal roxanne greer declined to comment on the fourth-graders suspension citing confidentiality policies according to the odessa american who first reported aidens troubles friday
911 when youre a company the size of apple whose co-founder steve jobs famously made comments about how its not the job of users to know what they want youd be forgiven for thinking they dont listen to the little guy
911 over the weekend a story popped up on reddit however revealing how one user supposedly convinced tim cook to change apples on-hold music telling him that it sounded distorted and therefore surprisingly un-apple-like in its lack of quality cook apparently listened and hey presto people dialling into apple now get better-sounding hold music while they wait
911 the full post can be read below
911 i once sent tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with apple it was super low quality therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because i was on hold for <number> minutes for something so simple iphone didnt turn on needed to set up a repair as in my country no apple store have to send it to another country
911 much to my surprise a lady from cupertino called me up the next day saying shed received a concerning email from tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone that tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done she assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections
911 the next time i called apple the hold music was indeed very pleasant
911 like steve jobs tim cooks email sorry you need javascript to see this e-mail address is public and there are multiple stories of him responding to those who email him during his <number> address at auburn university cook commented that i receive hundreds of e-mails from customers every day and i read them all
911 apparently he has quite the efficient team of personal assistants to turn that reading into actions as well

914 nope argentinas president cristina fernndez de kirchner has not become godmother of a jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf despite what you may have read in multiple news reports
914 over the past few days the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet picked up by news organisations around the world including haaretz buzzfeed the independent and the huffington post
914 like all good urban myths the articles were based on a grain of truth by tradition the seventh son or daughter born to an argentine family is eligible to become the godson or daughter of the president until this month the honour had only been bestowed on christian babies but on wednesday iair tawil not a baby but the strapping <number>-year old son of a rabbi became the countrys first jewish presidential godson
914 in her twitter account kirchner described tawil <number> as completely sweet and lit hanukkah candles with his family

914 but somehow the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizn argentinas equivalent to the european werewolf according to some versions of the myth the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse
914 evidently the chance meeting of a latin american president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism
914 but according to argentine historian daniel balmaceda there is no link between the two traditions the local myth of the lobizn is not in any way connected to the custom that began over <number> years ago by which every seventh son or seventh daughter born in argentina becomes godchild to the president he said

916 it is the mother spirit of the rainforest from this spirit-tree came the life force of all things living they have destroyed aotlcp-awak they have brought darkness upon not only our people but the whole world explains local tribesman leader tahuactep of the matss tribe
916 native communities alarmed local media outlets and conservation groups when aotlcp-awak or mother tree in local dialects was reported sawed down by heavy machinery
916 anna golding local researcher for non profit organization and conservancy group rainforest protection coalition rpc an initiative stemming from berkeley university in california believes the incident was intentionnal there are large portions of this national reserve that are rich in oil and natural gas there has been committed action by energy corporations to lobby the government to exploit the area for years the protected zones have been cut in half over the past decade and this is only their latest attempt to get rid of the local populations who are fighting to preserve their cultural heritage and lifestyle she admits

935 the spur-of-the-moment biopsy caused rivers  vocal cords to seize up in what 's called a laryngospasm the daily news source said the clinic had countered the biopsy allegation last wednesday saying in a statement that a biopsy of vocal cords has never been performed at yorkville endoscopy adding that although monitored or light to moderate sedation occurred at the clinic general anesthesia was never administered the statement referred to clinic procedures in general not the rivers case specifically rivers was rushed from the upper east side clinic to manhattan 's mt sinai hospital on aug <number> after she reportedly stopped breathing during the outpatient procedure an upper endoscopy in which a tiny camera was inserted in her throat to examine that part of the digestive system

937 murderous cult figurehead charles manson now <number> and in prison for life received a marriage license back in november so that he could tie the knot with afton star elaine burton <number> who comes off in interviews like another crazed admirer she might be more than that though their license has lapsed without a wedding and one journalist claims it 's because manson got wise to star 's alleged plan to acquire his corpse and put it on public display for money holy shit really here 's what we know
937 daniel simone who 's working on a book about manson told page six that star burton and her associate craig gray wolf hammond have been scheming for two years to open a lenin 's tomb-style attraction in california with the madman 's body on view in a glass case
937 when the two asked manson to sign his body over to them simone says he would n't give a definitive answer he just led them on so they 'd keep bringing him toiletries and other items in prison the marriage plot was the next step according to simone an attempt to ensure star would get manson 's remains after his death
937 there 's certain things next of kin can do she told the ap last november saying she wanted to work on manson 's case and the marriage would give her access to confidential information she did n't mention the body
937 and now manson has let their <number>-day marriage certificate lapse
937 he 's finally realized that he 's been played for a fool simone claims adding that manson thinks burton 's plan for his body is stupid because he feels he will never die now manson allegedly does n't want to get married at all
937 that 's not what burton and hammond 's website claims though they say manson plans to renew the license and the wedding was only postponed due to an unexpected interruption in logistics
937 but who 's playing whom here back in <number> when burton first announced her engagement to manson in rolling stone manson dismissed her
937 he snorts oh that he says that 's a bunch of garbage you know that man that 's trash we 're just playing that for public consumption manson also called star his baby on the floor implying that he was manipulating her like he did the other women in his murderous family like them she shaved her head and carved an x into her forehead at his request

940 two decades ago the chain 's patented ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas time-consuming mcpizzas were the the mcwraps of their day so most were gone by <number> it 's not clear where greg mills 's locations in the very small towns of pomeroy ohio and spencer west virginia are getting their raw materials for the discontinued menu items but mysteriously they 're still selling judy norman an employee who 's been at the west virginia spot for <number> years tells canadacom its the same pizza as they sold when she started there <number> years ago and its presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the <number>s in other words there may be a way to tap into all that nostalgia but that does n't mean it 's not freezer-burnt

943 ibm is expected to go through a massive reorg next month that will reportedly see <number> of its <number>-strong work force let go or <number> people if that figure holds true that would make it far and away the largest corporate layoff event in history breaking the record previously held by ibm when it cut <number> in <number>
943 featured resource
943 presented by jive software <number> commandments of collaboration for exceptional customer service read this whitepaper to discover best practices that drive brand affinity repeat business and learn more the report comes from long-time silicon valley journalist robert x cringely who recently published an ebook on ibm 's issues entitled the decline and fall of ibm he blamed past ceos louis gerstner and sam palmisano for making the mess and current ceo virginia rometty has done nothing to address them
943 the problem is a complex mess of bad management like laying off important people in the middle of a project to getting sidetracked with pie-in-the-sky ideas like commercializing watson and failing to adjust to the new era the m in ibm may mean machines but hardware is less than <number> of its business two-thirds is in services and the services pipeline has dried up
943 why well according to an ex-ibmer i spoke to some time ago who confirmed what cringely wrote in his book ibm is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud if you do n't have a data center you do n't need an ibm service contract to manage it
943 that 's why ibm grabbed softlayer the cloud services provider it needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind microsoft google and amazon since the purchase <number> months ago ibm has put a huge amount of money into softlayer and there has been a number of announcements around softlayer services
943 cringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts which is pretty stupid considering ibm announced the new z<number> mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales that wo n't be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it cutting storage is also foolish as we are in the era of big data and data lakes and storage is vital to these concepts
943 and you have to wonder what a layoff of <number> people will do to the firm that has to be jarring i remember an old advertisement from the print days that said what 's worse getting laid off on a friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following monday this will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors who will likely spend time updating their linkedin profiles

946 last night pandos michael carney cited a well-placed source who claims that apple is on the verge of buying flailing social network path today on stage at techcrunch disrupt path founder dave morin was asked about the report
946 morins response was straight from the dummies guide to media training we dont comment on rumors or speculation when techcrunchs matthew panzarino pointed out thats not a no morin repeated his response
946 there are a couple of things to note here for one thing from a pr point of view morins response was exactly right if the deal is about to happen then hes hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time if the deal isnt about to happen morin can still benefit from the idea that path is still valuable to someone
946 and yet its interesting how morins no comment flies in the face of a promise he made to pandos sarah lacy last year about how he and path would deal with the press in future as sarah explained at the time
946 i explained the problem from the journalists side and asked morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog not a favorable one but a fair one something that helps readers more than the denial the reporter speculation and the rewritten press release he said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything if a reporter gets a scoop and its accurate and he or she calls him up hell say congratulations and tell them to run with it no more playing games
946 given morins response on stage today and the fact carney contacted him last night for comment but received no response perhaps a more accurate promise would have been no more playing games unless im scared shitless of upsetting apple

2222 of all the apple rumors coming out of the far east recently the one with the most legitimacy seems to be apple producing an iphone with a <number>-inch display next year
2222 although the reports are unsubstantiated returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for apple
2222 according to the electronic times of taiwan the supply chain for apple production in <number> includes the components for a smaller handset than the iphone <number>
2222 the report states that apple is producing the smaller model for the convenience of single-handed operation of female users

2222 the new phone is rumored to be replacing the iphone <number>c model the <number>c has been apples budget model since its release in september <number>
2222 the <number>c lacked many of the features of the <number>s model such as using the apple <number> models a<number> chip instead of the a<number> that came with the <number>s not having touch id lacking the m<number> motion co-processor and other minor features the iphone <number>c was discontinued in september <number> when the iphone <number> was announced

2222 apple stayed with a <number>-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger steve jobs founder of apple said in <number> that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to get your hands around it

2565 the white house says that president trump fired james comey on tuesday because he received a brief letter from attorney general jeff sessions calling for the fbi directors dismissal that letter relies on a longer memo in which deputy attorney general rod rosenstein recommends that comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the hillary clinton email scandal during the campaign a white house spokesman told politico that trump did not request the letters and had no idea that they were coming
2565 as new york contributor roger parloff notes this memo might have made sense if it was issued on day one of the trump administration but for it to suddenly come out on may <number> <number> after the nation has watched and listened to trump warmly defend and commend comeys conduct in countless tweets and interviews renders its content simply incredible
2565 plus the presidents short letter to comey says nothing about the clinton probe but references the investigation into the trump campaigns possible russia ties saying i greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that i am not under investigation
2565 sure enough several outlets reported early on wednesday morning that comeys dismissal was actually about trumps anger over the fbis russia probe and comeys media appearances the president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week and maybe much longer it appears this moment from january <number> when trump greeted comey by blowing him a kiss and commenting oh and theres james hes become more famous than me was a sign that comeys days as director were numbered
2565 according to the wall street journal in recent months trump became irritated that comey was receiving more media attention and wasnt using his newfound fame to quash the rumors about trumps russia ties
2565 the more james comey showed up on television discussing the fbis investigation into possible ties between the trump campaign and russia the more the white house bristled according to aides to president donald trump
2565 frustration was growing among top associates of the president that mr comey in a series of appearances before a senate panel wouldnt publicly tamp down questions about possible collusion with russian interference in the <number> presidential race a person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted mr comey to say those three little words theres no ties politico reports that trump was particularly angry about comey confirming to the senate in march that the fbi had been investigating his campaign since last summer and the directors refusal to back up his claim that president obama wiretapped him hed even taken to shouting at his tv over the russia investigation
2565 he had grown enraged by the russia investigation two advisers said frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around russia he repeatedly asked aides why the russia investigation wouldnt disappear and demanded they speak out for him he would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe one adviser said only a handful of top advisers including sessions and rosenstein knew trump was planning to fire comey according to cnn the pair started fine-tuning their rationale for firing comey after they learned trump wanted him gone
2565 it appears those in the know seriously underestimated the ramifications of the president dismissing the official leading an investigation into his campaign sources told politico that the white house thought comeys firing would be win-win since hed been criticized by both democrats and republicans trump called several senators to inform them of his decision on monday evening and was reportedly taken aback when senate minority leader chuck schumer told him he was making a huge mistake

2573 on <number> may <number> fox news published an explosive report linking the death of murdered democratic national committee staffer seth rich to tens of thousands of e-mails allegedly found on his laptop computer fox reported that the e-mails were internal democratic national committee messages rich transferred to gavin mcfayden a now-deceased investigative journalist who then sent them to the document-dumping web site wikileaks
2573 the fox report claimed that there was a conspiracy between the local police department the federal bureau of investigation and the dc mayors office to cover up the investigation
2573 an fbi forensic report of richs computer generated within <number> hours after richs murder showed he made contact with wikileaks through gavin macfadyen a now-deceased american investigative reporter documentary filmmaker and director of wikileaks who was living in london at the time the federal source told fox news
2573 i have seen and read the emails between seth rich and wikileaks the federal investigator told fox news confirming the macfadyen connection he said the emails are in possession of the fbi while the stalled case is in the hands of the washington police department
2573 the revelation is consistent with the findings of wheeler whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of richs family to probe the case
2573 my investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between seth rich and wikileaks wheeler said i do believe that the answers to who murdered seth rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the dc police or fbi headquarters

2573 almost two weeks later on <number> july <number> wikileaks dumped a load of hacked e-mails that would embarrass the dnc and create a media frenzy in the months before the election the timing of the incidents as well as richs employment at the dnc led to conspiracy theories tying his death to the leak adding to the confusion wikileaks offered a <number> reward for information leading to the conviction of richs killer since his death richs family has consistently denied rumors linking him to wikileaks
2573 the fox news story about rich came one day after a report by the washington post accused president donald trump of spilling classified information to russian envoys during their visit to the oval office on <number> may <number> brad bauman a spokesperson for richs family told us he believed the fox story was motivated by a desire to deflect attention away from the post report

1113 antakya turkey middlemen with ties to the islamic state of iraq and syria isis have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days with the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the us hostages in its custody instead beheading three of them since july its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed
1113 three sources in contact with isis or its associates told buzzfeed news that it wants to sell the remains of james foley the us journalist whose august death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of western hostages by isis hands they said isis wants <number> million for foleys body which it would deliver across the border to turkey and that the group was willing to provide a dna sample to facilitate a deal
1113 if true the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided isis with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity as well as the groups cold calculation as it works to raise more cash
1113 at one point early this year isis held <number> western hostages in syria fifteen europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms but the british and american hostages remained both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms in the months since foleys death isis has released videotaped executions of the us journalist steven sotloff the british aid worker alan henning and the us aid worker peter kassig british journalist john cantlie and a us woman a <number>-year-old aid worker remain in isis hands
1113 all three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety

2151 residents of mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both iraq and syria has provided a sustained source of funding the organization also opened trade canals through kurdish territories in iraq and turkey with the help of kurdish turkish and iranian traders

2151 the fourth source of funding is transforming the city of nineveh adjacent to turkish borders into a new center for drug trafficking the russian federal drug control service said is was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing afghan heroin which is sent from iraq to europe

2576 in january a group of cornell university undergraduates travelled to the mekong river delta of vietnam a region of the world considered to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change there they met with farmers climate experts government officials and their peers and learned about the ominous changes taking place in the mekong that ultimately will impact us all
2576 the trip was part of course intended to help millennials better appreciate the interconnected and interdependent world they live in and to fully grasp what is ahead for vietnam and for them a grand challenge on a grand scale about the time these students turn <number> sea-level rise will have displaced an estimated million residents of the mekong delta
2576 by <number> much of the region will likely be underwater affecting millions more to say nothing about the impacts on major american cities including miami beach boston and new york that like the mekong have considerable real estate at risk from rising sea levels
2576 changes caused by rising sea levels are already flooding into the mekong delta especially in the rural areas where vietnam grows much of its food our group of cornell students learned that rains now fall during what was once the dry season interfering with seed set and reducing rice yields
2576 increasing salt-water intrusion is forcing farmers to abandon rice altogether and switch to more salt-tolerant options such as shrimp production and crops such as coconut and watermelons more groundwater is being used to dilute salty water for irrigation and drinking which in turn results in land subsidence and exacerbated saltwater intrusion
2576 from this two-week journey to a country <number> miles from home and at the forefront of our greatest global challenge the students gathered stories to tell and share with the world because what is happening in vietnam will be repeated globally
2576 one of the first things the students learned was that climate change is accepted as fact in vietnam it is not politicized and is discussed freely messages to take home the vietnamese people do not avoid talking about the changing climate its happening in their own backyard said conor mccabe an animal science major class of <number> climate change is definitely an uncomfortable topic since it has so many ramifications for society and the livelihoods of everyday people taking part in that difficult discussion rather than shying away is what i plan to do from now on said becky cardinali an economics major class of <number>
2576 these millennials also learned that despite the history of the vietnam war and the role the us now plays in exacerbating climate change the vietnamese people were extraordinarily welcoming i felt so embarrassed that i had contributed to the climate change that was destroying their livelihoods how did they repay me by inviting me into their homes for tea they did not hate us in fact they were extremely welcoming hopeful and forward looking said marc alessi an up-and-coming meteorologist class of <number>
2576 one of the more salient moments during their visit occurred when students heard a vietnamese government official explain that the evidence for climate change and its cause is well established and for them it is not a hoax as the students observed climate change is not a hoax for the rest of the world nor is it a distant future threat my time in the mekong delta served as a reminder that for many climate change is immediate said gail fletcher majoring in history and government class of <number>

1124 despite an extensive search by police officers at the scene the mans penis was never located and authorities believe it may have been eaten by a stray dog or cat

1151 the calendar may have just flipped to <number> but saudi arabia is partying like it 's <number>
1151 the daily mail reports that saudia the kingdom 's national airline will introduce gender-segregated flights except close relatives men and women flying on saudia can reportedly look forward to assigned seating based on their naughty bits
1151 the discriminatory practice stems from multiple complaints lodged by male fliers who were unhappy that other men were allowed to sit next to their wives and female family members some men also objected to the conduct of a female flight attendant which they deemed too flirty
1151 the change was first reported by gulf media outlets according to the daily mail there are solutions to this problem saudia assistant manager for marketing abdul rahman al fahd told ajel a saudi arabian newspaper we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers
1151 the airline will apparently include orders for flight-booking staff on the ground to make sure men and women are separated emirates<number> reports according to mashable however a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers
1151 saudia already follows a variety of religious practices onboard including the prohibition of alcohol and pork dishes and reading a quran verse before takeoff the airline also chooses not to hire saudi women to work as cabin crew
1151 source getty similar complaints have been heard on flights traveling to israel in september a flight headed to tel aviv from new york was delayed because several ultra-orthodox jewish men would n't sit next to women who were n't family members more recently a delta flight was delayed for half an hour because ultra-orthodox men refused to be seated next to women and other passengers would n't change seats with them
1151 one chicago woman started a petition on changeorg to stop the practice of forcing women to change seats arguing that one person 's religious rights do not trump another person 's civil rights
1151 she 's right and the same could be said of discriminatory rules like those that saudia reportedly plans to introduce but given its already troubled history of the treatment of women it was ranked the third-worst country in the arab world for women these new guidelines unfortunately appear to be more of the same

2244 the iphone <number> and <number> plus are two of the more exciting products apple has unleashed in quite some time of the two differences are slight but the camera hardware apple went with on the iphone <number> plus is a good reason to stop and consider which you really want a new rumor suggests those still standing in front of tables at the apple store might want to walk away for a few months as the iphone <number>s camera might end up being even better than the iphone <number> plus
2244 according to moneyudn the iphone <number>s will have a dual-lens camera weve heard similar rumblings before as sony announced new camera hardware for mobile devices with a dual lens sony makes the camera hardware for apples iphone so dual lens isnt so sensational
2244 optical zoom though thats interesting according to money the iphone <number>s will have an optical zoom feature which is something smartphones generally slouch on rather than rely on digital enhancements a hardware fix for zoom may be inbound
2244 as if a cool new camera wasnt enough the report also cites supply chain sources on pressure sensors which apple is said to include on the next iphone one sensor will track blood pressure and heart rate which makes sense for apples healthkit but ultimately seems to clumsy for an iphone
2244 iphone-<number>-nfc-<number>x<number>-<number>x<number>
2244 the second sensor is even more hard to understand supply chain sources say that one will be made available for use with a <number>d interface weve seen job openings for apples vr initiatives which are kind of <number>d but its early on for anything <number>d for an iphone and its an unlikely aesthetic change for apples ios in the wake of ios <number>s visual update theres no way apple would go full <number>d
2244 finally the report suggests apple is ditching the <number>gb iphone base model for a <number>gb version if thats true good on them its overdue
2244 much of these rumors seem like foie gras force-fed from patent filings and other news tidbits a new camera is likely and were sure apple is at least entertaining the idea of dropping the underwhelming <number>gb model as for <number>d or extra sensors packed into the iphone <number>s were not going to bite on that one

1186 on october <number> rumors began to spread on social media that a kurdish female fighter known by the pseudonym rehana may have been beheaded by islamic state isis militants in kobani
1186 dubbed the poster child for kobani female warriors rehana a fighter in the kurdish ypj people 's protection units militia captured the public 's imagination after her photograph was circulated on the internet the image of rehana making a victory sign was retweeted hundreds of times along with the claim that she was singlehandedly responsible for killing over a hundred isis militants

1186 the fact that the claims and rumors of rehana 's possible brutal killing have garnered so much attention is testament to the enormous public interest in female fighters in the syrian kurdish ypj and iraqi kurdish peshmerga militias
1186 reports have dubbed the women badass battle-hardened and fanatical fighters the interest is unsurprising these are all-female fighters waging war on isis militants who are not only a formidable military force but whose repressive and violent islamist ideology is in stark contrast to any progressive feminist philosophy that allows women to go to war

1191 since the programs inception michelle obamas healthy hunger-free kids act has offended the sensibilities of the entire nation
1191 conservatives found the program to be invasive thrusting dcs hand into local education matters educators found the program wasted enormous amounts of food and money parents found the lunches far too light to be considered meals and school children everywhere took to the internet with pictures of the gruesome dishes the program sloshed onto their cafeteria trays every day
1191 those pictures did massive amounts of damage to michelles pet program but now an even worse pr disaster rears its head this week the uk daily mail ran pictures of what other countries feed their school children the comparison is stark and humiliating for the united states

1191 compare this insult to parents palettes and taxpayers alike with what other nations feed their school children the contrast below is striking to say the least
1191 there you have it those are samples from a bankrupt mediterranean nation a former second-world nation a financially stricken european nation a favela-ridden south american nation and some of our other allies

1207 the islamic state isis is harvesting organs of its victims to finance its terrorist army the iraqi ambassador to the united nations said tuesday
1207 we have bodies come and examine them said ambassador mohamed alhakim referring to the un security council it is clear they are missing certain parts here is how he described bodies as missing kidneys and showing marks of surgical incisions when we discover mass graves we look at the bodies some of those bodies are killed by bullets some of them by knives but when you find pieces of the back is sic missing and the kidneys is sic missing you will wonder what it is his report reveals that the isis never fails to shock the world he declared that the isis executed a dozen doctors in mosul because they refused to cooperate to remove organs
1207 alhakim is replacing outgoing ambassador nikolay mladenov who told the security council its very clear that the tactics isis is using expand by the day
1207 the isis controls territory that includes the airports in mosul in iraq and aleppo in syria giving it the ability to ship human organs to traffickers
1207 he said is has access to airports in mosul and in the syrian city of aleppo from which it could transport the illicit organs to international middlemen and buyers
1207 no less shocking is that the western world is treating the report as if it did not know months ago that the islamic state has resorted to harvesting human organs
1207 al-monitor reported last december <number> the third funding source besides oil sales and taxes on residents was exposed by otolaryngologist siruwan al-mosuli he said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in mosul arab and foreign surgeons were hired but prohibited from mixing with local doctors information then leaked about organ selling surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped
1207 the western world not least of all the obama administration chose not to disseminate the information in hopes of postponing the inevitable a declaration of war on the isis
1207 valuable time has been lost by imagining that the islamic state is the problem of iraq and syria and not of the entire world
1209 south african police have been accused of not doing enough to crack down on a sick new sport that replaces fighting dogs with children
1209 kids as young as nine-years-old are getting onto all fours and scratching and biting other children growling and snarling in the process
1209 and in a bizarre twist the winners of the fights are rewarded just like a real dogs by allowing them to have sex with other children
1209 although the sex act is only simulated it has shocked the country after it was revealed in local media to become a regular happening in the district of ekurhuleni in the south african city of johannesburg
1209 inspector wendy willson from the special investigations unit at the national council of spcas nspca confirmed that they had started an investigation after reports that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries
1209 teachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play while other pupils were placing bets on who would win she said the activity had developed among children who had been watching real dogfights at the weekends with their parents and were mimicking the action at school it is not clear if the children take part in the sport due to peer pressure or under encouragement of adults
1209 willson said she had witnessed the children getting down on all fours barking growling biting and scratching each other
1209 she said they rip into each other the play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury
1209 she also recorded a video of one fight which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example

1216 that north korean leader is a mysterious fellow quite apart from the mandatory hairstyle the rapid weight gain and the did-he-or-didnt-he execution games lately the supreme leader has kinda just disappeared the usually spotlight-loving head of state is not in the press not at events and not at meetings thats right kim jong-un has been missing for several weeks and no ones quite sure why
1216 the last time that kim made a public appearance was sept <number> when he went to a concert with his wife since then the media hasnt heard a peep from the dictator according to the ap on thursday he didnt even show up to the reopening of north koreas supreme peoples assembly a super high-level meeting at the pyongyang parliament its the first time hes missed such an important event since <number> when his father died
1216 there are a lot of questions one could ask about the north korean dictator does he really rule the country or is he simply under the thumb of the intriguing organization and guidance department does he really love theme parks and brutal prison camps simultaneously or are the water slides just an image booster why would anyone ever want a mushroom-flavored sports drink but the most important question is this why oh why is he hiding
1216 here are three reported reasons the north korean dictator is lying low
1216 possible reason no <number> cheese apparently
1216 its true several news sources including the daily mirror are suggesting that most sinister culprit emmental apparently kim really really loves the swiss cheese who doesnt and has huge amounts imported for his own personal consumption i would too if i could but its possible hes been enjoying the delicious snack just a little too enthusiastically hes gained a lot of weight really quickly and the media noticed that the last time he was in public he was walking with a limp
1216 in other words the north korean leader may be out of action because hes made himself ill by eating too much cheese strangely this is the most endearing ive ever found the dictator
1216 possible reason no <number> gout
1216 another explanation for the weight gain and limp gout in fact a type of arthritis gout causes intense pain and sometimes weight gain so maybe its not all the emmentals fault after all michael madden a journalist for the <number> north website said that based on his gait it appears he has gout something due to diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the kim family

1228 iraq 's ambassador to the un claimed wednesday that isis has been forcing doctors to harvest organs from the bodies of the people it 's killed and then selling those organs to fund its operations according to an ap report ambassador mohamed alhakim called for a security council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys
1228 according to alkalim a dozen doctors have been killed in mosul because they would n't take part in the islamic state 's organ trafficking scheme
1228 unconfirmed rumors of isis removing and selling organs have been around since at least december when middle east news outlet al-monitor published an article with more detailed claims than alkalim made this week
1228 based on a report from one doctor in mosul al-monitor wrote
1228 surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped
1228 he said that organ sales yield large profits a specialized mafia is engaged in these operations in addition to medical institutions working in other countries without coordination among these parties such a trade can not be sustained he said the al-monitor story also claims that the un 's office of the high commissioner for human rights confirmed the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in december but seems to be based entirely on this single source as far as i can tell there 's no mention of the trafficking operation in ohchr 's published reports on iraq and alkalim did n't mention ohchr in his statement to the security council
1228 the islamic state is incredibly money-hungry newsweek reported in a detailed look at the revenue streams isis uses to support the <number> million people in its territories including more than <number> active fighters there 's no mention of selling kidneys but isis needs all the money it can get and if they 're willing to conduct small-time local kidnappings for as little as <number> moving organs is n't so farfetched
1228 there 's still no conclusive evidence though the islamic state is the international boogeyman of the moment and its confirmed actions are heinous enough to make any rumor sound plausible but it 's also been the subject of several online hoaxes and conspiracy theories
1228 it 's probably best to withhold judgment until the un does what alkahim suggests and examines the bodies
1229 apple is forecast to have shipped a whopping <number> million iphones over the <number> holiday quarter on strong iphone <number> demand according to one well-connected analyst who also expects a busy start to <number> for the company with apple watch sales in march and a rumored <number>-inch macbook air coming sometime before april
1229 in a research note from well-connected kgi analyst ming-chi kuo obtained by appleinsider apple 's latest iphone <number> and iphone <number> plus models led a charge to <number> million overall unit sales for the quarter ending december the analyst estimates the <number>-inch iphone <number> to hit more than <number> million while the larger <number>-inch iphone <number> phablet contributed with just over <number> million unit sales
1229 if the numbers hold up apple is in for a record-smashing holiday quarter kuo 's estimates are well above expectations from other leading investment banks including ubs which earlier this month forecast apple to sell <number> million iphones
1229 momentum from apple 's iphone <number> lineup will spill into the first quarter driving overall iphone shipments to an about <number> million unit sales a performance of that caliber would buffer seasonally slow sales
1229 consistent with the latest reports kuo also expects the highly anticipated apple watch to launch in march while apple has stayed mum on exact specifications the company could fill in the blanks with a special announcement prior to the device 's debut the analyst said
1229 assuming a march launch apple watch is expected to sell <number> million units in the first quarter meaning those sales will be spread across a relatively short one-month span kuo says most component suppliers will see shipments in the <number> million to <number> million unit range through the march quarter but a few manufacturers are seeing low yields on key parts slowing down final assembly and shipping
1229 on apple 's rumored <number>-inch macbook air with retina display kuo is forecasting a ship-by date sometime this quarter the all-new thin-and-light said to sport a retina display ultra-thin form factor and intel 's latest mobile chips will help fuel a <number>-percent quarter-over-quarter increase in mac shipments kuo expects mac sales to hit <number> million units for the first three months of <number> up slightly from <number> million forecast for q<number> <number>
1229 aside from industry scuttlebutt not much is known about apple 's ultraportable newcomer a set of photos posted online yesterday purportedly show the laptop 's display assembly which boasts edge-to-edge glass with black bezels and eschews the usual translucent apple logo for a polished insert more in line with the latest ios devices
1229 finally kuo sees drooping sell through for ipad as apple 's recently released ipad air <number> and ipad mini <number> models largely failed to move the needle during the holiday season for the december quarter estimates put ipad shipments down <number> percent year-over-year to <number> million units moving into the first quarter of <number> ipad could hit <number> million unit sales but the number is still weak down <number> percent compared to the same time last year
1230 people wanting to buy an apple watch may be able to ask for a custom engraving much as the company has allowed with products like the ipad and ipod before it although the option may not be available in time for the product 's launch
1230 then information comes french website iphonote citing a source claimed to be tied to apple the person allegedly said they are virtually certain engraving will become available whether sooner or later
1230 if the company follows its past pattern of past engraving options such as with the ipad and ipod only online orders will qualify
1230 one question is where an engraving would fit on the diminutive wearable apple watch there is very little space around the bezels of the watch and the underside is dominated by a heartrate sensor as well as some of apple 's own markings such as the serial number
1230 iphonote is relatively unknown site with no established track record apple does however have a history of offering engravings for iphones ipods and ipads
1230 conventional watches are frequently engraved moreover and the option would make sense given apple 's emphasis on personalization in official marketing the company has taken the watch to a number of fashion magazines and highlighted different combinations of body materials and wrist straps
1230 more details about the product are due to be announced at a monday press event whee appleinsider will be in attendance with live coverage the company is already preparing san francisco 's yerba buena center by raising apple logos and building an exterior structure thought to house a demonstration area

1290 either lenovo is very serious about stepping up its mobile phone business or it is getting very desperate aside from setting up a third mobile business to target china specifically rumors are resurfacing that lenovo is eying to buy blackberry out of its woes or perhaps the two moves are one and the same which does n't make sense either whatever lenovo has planned we might very well know this week as sources close to the matter tip that lenovo will be making an offer to buy blackberry sometime this week
1290 this is n't exactly the first time that the largest pc maker has set its eyes on blackberry it was exactly a year ago since we last heard about the chinese firm 's interest in the canadian company of course neither company confirmed nor denied the matter the canadian government however was allegedly working in the background to have it blocked due to security concerns of a chinese company buying out a canadian one
1290 fast-forward to today lenovo is said to make a <number> per share offer to blackberry possibly ending up at around <number> per share if any of this is true lenovo would be what others would call it spreading itself thin across continents it was lately rumored to be planning on starting a new mobile phone venture in china specifically to rival top dog xiaomi while still maintaining its own lenovo branded smartphones in that country in the us it is still waiting to conclude the acquisition of motorola mobility whose name and sales also extend to other countries if it does or at least tries to acquire blackberry then it means that the company is willing to have a fourth mobile business under its control
1290 the other big question is whether blackberry is willing to sell there have been many rumors and offers during the height of the company 's financial crisis none of which have come to pass as blackberry has soldiered on to keep its own brand and business under its own direction if you only look at news coverage the company does n't seem to be in as dire straits which makes the prospect of a buyout even less enticing plus the company has just launched a fresh new attempt at both the smartphone and the enterprise market and is n't exactly done yet whether those are actually enough to keep blackberry afloat is too early to tell which might be another reason it would not be so interested in an acquisition

2567 donald trump has said he was thinking of this russia thing when he decided james comeys fate contradicting the white house rationale that he fired the fbi director for mishandling the clinton email investigation
2567 comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between trump advisers and russian officials when he was dismissed by the president defending that decision in an interview on nbc news on thursday trump said and in fact when i decided to just do it i said to myself i said you know this russia thing with trump and russia is a made up story its an excuse by the democrats for having lost an election that they shouldve won
2567 trump also said there were three occasions on which comey assured him he was not under investigation the president said he called the director of the fbi to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with russia
2567 acting fbi head disputes white house claim comey had lost staff support read more in the nbc interview trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire james comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general
2567 trump recalled three conversations with comey about the fbi investigation into russian interference in last years presidential election first he said there was a dinner which was also about comeys future raising the prospect that trump could threaten his job
2567 he wanted to stay on at the fbi trump said and i said ill you know consider and see what happens but we had a very nice dinner and at that time he told me you are not under investigation
2567 acting fbi director refutes claims that staff lost faith in comey then there were two phone calls one made by trump another by comey the president admitted i actually asked him yes i said if its possible would you let me know am i under investigation he said you are not under investigation
2567 the revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism perceptions that trump fired comey because of the russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal meanwhile trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal but highly irregular on thursday trumps words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general loretta lynchs controversial meeting with bill clinton last june during the investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state
2567 matthew miller a former spokesman for the department of justice told msnbc its completely inappropriate for trump to ask that question it would also be a violation of doj rules for james comey to answer it

2270 after news broke yesterday that jasmine tridevil <number> of tampa had allegedly paid <number> to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself unattractive to men we ve heard whispers in the wind and read stories that this third boob is a stunt a hoax it very well might be urlzz
2270 professional debunkers snopes has classified tridevil 's third boob story as false largely because almost all of the alleged evidence photo video is coming directly from tridevil herself no family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand and tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable they point out that in this youtube video posted to her page tridevil 's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body
2270 trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with wtsp last night where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts when the reporter asked for another longer look tridevil declined telling the reporter i 'm not ready to do that right now because it 's in episode six of my show
2270 yes tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network fitting because according to the snoops at snopes this apparently is n't the first time tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star well a woman claiming to be jasmine tridevil at least jasminetridevilcom which has since expired was registered to a alisha hessler one who bears a striking resemblance to a tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before
2270 last year hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading i beat women honk if i 'm a scumbag in a busy intersection police made multiple attempts to follow up with hessler about the incident but she apparently refused all the calls
2270 and in march of <number> snopes reports hessler was booked in tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge
2270 doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen namely because tridevilhessler 's case raises mental health red flags nilesh sojitra of the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons told buzzfeed
2270 this is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery she will now be scarred for life and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery additionally the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would
2270 and dr dan greenwald of bayshore plastic surgery told wtsp i think its very extreme and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention is there some instability is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person
1345 the story went like this a young argentinian man named yair tawil just turned <number> years old and was adopted by the countrys president cristina fernandez de kirchhner why did she do it its simple really due to argentinian folklore the president was required to adopt the boy in order to prevent him from turning into a werewolf at least thats what people believed from new york daily news

1345 like all good urban myths the articles were based on a grain of truth by tradition the seventh son or daughter born to an argentine family is eligible to become the godson or daughter of the president until this month the honour had only been bestowed on christian babies but on wednesday iair tawil not a baby but the strapping <number>-year old son of a rabbi became the countrys first jewish presidential godson
1345 somehow the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizn argentinas equivalent to the european werewolf according to some versions of the myth the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse

1354 as the apple tv becomes more smart-home hub than streaming box ive long held the position that a robust remote with the ability to run apps is a good idea and the ipod fits that purpose nicely still speculative but id much rather that than a new small iphone

1390 path was founded in <number> by ex-facebooker morin and napster co-founder shawn fanning in five rounds of funding to date the company has received <number> million in investments from <number> different investors
1390 path was originally conceived as a companion network to facebook for people to enjoy higher engagement with a smaller number of quality friends and contacts it specifically limited users to <number> in-network connections as a tip of the hat to dunbar 's number an idea in anthropology stating human brain size is such that we can only support meaningful relationships with <number> people where facebook would be a place for wishing distant acquaintances a noncommittal happy birthday path would be specifically for sincere communications with your smaller closer circle of friends and family

1394 apple rumors dont stop and today theres a fresh one that discusses what we might be able to expect from the iphone <number>s later this year todays rumors sound a bit outlandish but not out of the question
1394 according to moneyudn the iphone <number>s will pack new camera features including a dual-lens camera with a built-in optical zoom function optical zoom allows you to take clearer shots when zooming in on a subject as opposed to software-enabled zoom which often leaves the subject looking blurry or grainy storage options may also change
1394 udn cites supply chain sources who suggest apple will continue to offer the <number>-inch and <number>-inch screen sizes but will bump the entry-level iphone <number>siphone <number>s plus storage to <number>gb instead of <number>gb theres also reportedly some new display technology at work
1394 another supply chain legend discussed by udn suggests that the iphone <number>s will employ two pressure sensors one of which will have a role in health monitoringfunctions offering more accurate ways to track a users heart rate and blood pressure the site also lists a <number>d pressure sensor that may be built into the touch panel for an additional z axis to us that suggests possible <number>d user-interface interactions though udn instead points to <number>d imaging technologies that might take advantage of the pressure sensor
1394 one of those rumors lines up with a patent apple received in april of last year which discussed presssure-sensitive touchscreen technology that allows the display to distinguish between soft taps and stronger more forceful inputs that technology is also making its way into the apple watch
1394 wacky maybe a bit and the supply chain is often filled with outlandish rumors but again none of this seems completely out of the question whether these rumors come to fruition or not well we wont know until closer to september <number>

1409 silicon valley journalist robert x cringely author of the decline and fall of ibm says the notices could go out as soon as next week after ibm reported shrinking profits for an <number>th quarter
1409 ibm stock falls <number> after it downgrades earnings forecast the tech giant which relies on service contracts for a significant portion of its cash flow is suffering as companies shut down their internal data centres and move services to the cloud

1411 no one knows exactly where he came from no one knows why he was chosen to lead the islamic state and now in the past <number> hours reports have arrived saying abu bakr al-baghdadi is believed dead or merely wounded or critically wounded or unscathed or possibly not even at the scene of the attack
1411 following us airstrikes targeting islamic state commanders attending a clandestine meeting over the weekend few reports agree on the facts meanwhile american commanders cant or wont say whether or not he was even there or not let alone hurt
1411 the drama and ensuing confusion is fitting for baghdadi a shadowy figure whose myth may only be enhanced by the mystery surrounding his purported demise
1411 the saga deepened on sunday when iraqi defense minister said on facebook that baghdadis deputy was killed and that the self-described caliph was injured in the attack then abu muhammad al-adnani said to be the islamic states spokesman dispatched his own update perhaps you suspected that the caliphate ended with martyrdom of the caliph the jerusalem post quoted him saying i assure the islamic nation that the emir abu bakr al-baghdadi is well thank god and i wish him a speedy recovery the implication being that he was at least injured
1411 if so he would have escaped a fate that claimed other prominent islamic leaders the assassinations began in <number> that year abu musab al-zarqawi the leader of an earlier iteration of the islamic state was killed when us warplanes dropped two <number>-pound bombs on a house in which he met with other insurgency figures four years later an iraqi-american operation unleashed a barrage on a building in tikrit iraq killing the groups top two leaders and ushering in the tenure of an unknown figure named baghdadi
1411 not surprisingly those killings made baghdadi risk-averse and even more inclined than other militant leaders to a life inhabited in the shadows but while the leaders aversion to the public eye has protected baghdadi it has also allowed facts to melt into islamic state propaganda forging an identity that has become one of the most potent recruiting devices at the islamic states disposal
1411 the pitch baghdadi is a direct descendant of the prophet muhammad holds a doctorate in islamic studies and envisions a sunni-dominated caliphate that spans continents its a carefully crafted story that separates the islamic state from nearly every other islamic militant movement evidenced when fighters of the nusra front an al-qaeda offshoot battling in syria wanted to defect to the islamic state all they had to do reported the new york times was make a few phone calls pledge allegiance to baghdadi and their new life would begin
1411 the mystique of baghdadi experts suggest would make him all the more difficult to replace and his loss all the more significant the wounding and potential loss of baghdadi may be of more significance for his followers than adherents of other jihadist groups wrote theodore karasik senior adviser to the company risk insurance management baghdadi as caliph ibrahim to maintain his religious foundation needs to be of a whole body if he loses a limb in his injuries his credibility suffers if he dies the death would toss the entire concept of the legitimacy of the caliphate on its head
1411 using another name for the islamic state karasik added isis discourse will likely need to be revised

1414 it 's important to note that kuo has a stellar track record when it comes to apple which means this is likely more than just a rumor

1431 the details behind the medical treat of joan rivers have been trickling out since her passing almost two weeks ago cnn is reporting some shocking details tonight revolving around witness claims that rivers personal doctor allgedly took a selfie and biopsied the comedian before the cardiac arrest that sent her to hospital eventually ending her life from cnn
1431 a staff member at manhattans yorkville endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor who has not been publicly identified took a selfie photo in the procedure room while rivers was under anesthesia the source said
1431 rivers <number> was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor gastroenterologist dr lawrence cohen that procedure intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat involved the insertion of a camera down her throat
1431 after cohen the clinics medical director finished his work a biopsy was done on rivers without her prior consent according to the source

1448 the foreign intelligence service svr is reporting today that president putins order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the crimean federal district is intenselydirectly related to a missing and believed stolen low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in fort carson colorado which is a united states army installation located near the city of colorado springs
1448 according to the svr the atomic weapon missing from fort carson has been identified as a w<number> nuclear artillery shell that measures <number> mm <number> inches in diameter and <number> mm <number> inches long
1448 this report notes that the w<number> was produced in two models mod <number> and mod <number> which weighed <number> and <number> kg <number> and <number> pounds respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to <number> kiloton <number> tons of tnt
1448 though the us had reported that all of their w<number> nuclear shells had been retired by <number> this report says the svr has long noted their continued use for training by us army <number>th infantry division forces headquarter at fort carson and under the command of north american aerospace defense command norad forces operating from the cheyenne mountain nuclear bunker complex all of whom are located in el paso county colorado
1448 the specific us weapons platform designed to fire the w<number> this report notes is the paladin m<number>a<number> <number>mm artillery system <number>rd photo left which is currently operated by forces belonging to the <number>st brigade combat team of the <number>th infantry division

1448 of critical concern to the kremlin regarding this missing w<number> nuclear shell svr intelligence analysts in this report state is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past march by president barack obama that he named nukes on the loose and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic dirty bomb that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but western metropolis

1486 earlier this year apple bought beats music and beats electronics for <number> billion since then ceo tim cook has gone out of its way to rave about the beats music subscription service which sells all-you-can-eat music for <number> a month
1486 so why would apple plan to shut down beats music as a techcrunch headline reports
1486 answer its not
1486 tom neumayr says the techcrunch story is not true but wouldnt elaborate
1486 i can elaborate a bit more based on conversations with people familiar with apples thinking apple wont shutter the streaming service it may however modify it over time and one of those changes could involved changing the beats music brand
1486 note that apple does seem pretty pleased with the itunes brand which was the focus of its controversial u<number> album giveaway this month
1486 shuttering the beats music brand name makes some sense as the company hadnt generated a ton of traction before apple bought it in may at that time it only had a few hundred thousand subscribers on the other hand the beats headphone brand which apple doesnt have any plans to dump has a lot of recognition so it wouldnt have seemed bizarre
1490 jasmine tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible it is not plausible
1490 i believe <number> percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for dr matthew schulman a board-certified plastic surgeon in new york told the daily dot i would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible
1490 there are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about tridevils story the first is the photographic evidence of the third breast has been taken by tridevil and posted on her personal facebook page the lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered the daily dot wrote
1490 second creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast it would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required
1490 when asked about her surgery tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago she didnt mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery
1490 the final bit of evidence that suggests tridevils third breast is fake was the final result this technique would create a tight round breast in the center of the chest he said also all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures the photos show a soft pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast she essentially has a hanging breast and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure
1490 during a radio interview tridevil refused to give her real name but snopes pointed out she has a striking resemblance to alisha hessler the person to whom jasminetridevilcom is registered

1490 tridevil said on her facebook account tuesday alisha hessler is her real name she also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone elses identification to get into a club i was underage and wanted to get drunk lol she wrote

1514 what began as an occupy-inspired student sit-in exploded in hong kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators using tear gas pepper spray and rubber bullets the occupy central protests spread from hong kongs financial district to just outside the citys government offices in admiralty but the law-enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city the protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back at least for now heres what you need to know so far
1514 what started this
1514 after <number> years of british rule hong kong was returned to china in <number> but has operated semi-autonomously under whats known as one country two systems outside of beijings communist rule the promise was that in <number> hong kong would be allowed for the first time to elect its own leader known as chief executive in democratic elections instead of having the slot filled by a committee from beijing but earlier this summer china decided a committee was still necessary and it would select the candidates for hong kongs <number> elections outrage has been building ever since
1514 whos out there
1514 the protests were organized in part by the hong kong federation of students which has since called for an indefinite student strike the new york times reports young people are everywhere but not alone the hong kong professional teachers union has joined them with a general strike as have some professionals after the weekend violence office workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black t-shirts according to the times
1514 occupy central with love and peace meanwhile is led by a university of hong kong law professor named benny tai businessweek reported earlier this summer tai has been organizing for months and a look at his planning from june now serves as some serious foreshadowing
1514 at some point tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy central where most of hong kongs top banks and other financial institutions as well as bloomberg have their offices many companies are already taking no chances developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work
1514 what do they want
1514 in addition to democratic elections in <number> and continued autonomy for hong kong as previously promised protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive leung chun-ying the economics are also less than ideal and the country could be slipping into a recession
1516 saudi arabia has announced that it has the right to cover womens eyesespecially the tempting ones
1516 i love the looks of you the lure of you
1516 the sweet of you and the pure of you
1516 the eyes the arms and the mouth of you
1516 the east west north and the south of you
1516 cole porter
1516 its a safe bet that sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman of saudi arabias religious police isnt a fan of cole porter the lure of you is precisely why nabet announced yesterday that the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice will cover any womens eyes that are deemed tempting the men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes especially the tempting ones he said we have the right to do so
1516 what are tempting eyes one saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup or even without makeup if they are beautiful the woman will be in trouble the orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting but if they happen to rely on merriam-webster then it means having an appeal what is an appeal according to the dictionary it is arousing a sympathetic response and what is sympathetic showing empathy according to merriam-webster
1516 so there you have it to allow a womens eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world one must empathize with her very existence but the religious policemassively funded by king abdullahcannot do this its so stupid the saudi journalist tells me i dont know what to say they have to stop this many people will oppose this in the country they wont be silent

1527 techcrunch reports that apple plans to shut down beats music the streaming music service that it acquired earlier this year the blog 's josh constine says that he 's confirmed the news with five sources at both apple and beats and to be honest it makes sense
1527 it seems very unlikely that apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether if true news that beats music is dying reads as a clear indication that apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand itunes radio constine agrees
1527 considering apple 's penchant for simple unified brands and how it despises fragmentation shutting down beats music makes a lot of sense running a second music service in parallel with itunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers beats music 's ceo ian rogers was also put in charge of itunes radio meaning he 's already splitting his time rather than just focusing on beats music
1527 based on images of the home screen constine adds it looks like apple 's readying a new music app just for the new apple watch people thought the company 's music app for wearables would be beats music and maybe it sort of is on the back end it just wo n't be called beats music

1557 it may be <number> but one airline reportedly has plans to gender separate their passengers completely due to religious and modesty regulations the airline plans to enforce separation according to a spokesman for the company
1557 the airline in question is saudi arabias national airline saudia as reported on the rt website saudia wants to separate male and female air travellers mainly due to complaints from husbands who dont like unknown men sitting next to their wives
1557 saudia assistant manager for marketing abdul rahman al fahd told reporters there are solutions to this problemwe will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers
1557 as such the airline hopes to begin arranging for check-in staff at the airport to assign separate seating for their passengers unless they are closely related
1557 as widely reported it isnt just muslims who have these modesty issues as orthodox jews also have similar laws calling for the separation of men and women in public
1557 back in september an el al flight from new york to israels tel aviv ben gurion airport was delayed because some orthodox male flyers refused to sit next to women
1557 but while these religious practices are all fine for some people they are not suitable for others and certainly not on a public place like an airplane where flight crews are constantly working against the clock to ensure their aircraft takes off on time
1557 it terms of the faas rules for this type of crew disruption federal aviation regulations <number> <number> and <number> state that no person may assault threaten intimidate or interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmembers duties aboard an aircraft being operated
1557 it therefore remains to be seen what course of action will be taken by saudia airlines and if plans to separate people based on gender is even legal not to mention the logistical and ethical nightmare
1558 if theres one thing apple currently lacks its a good social layer to their various offerings perhaps to satiate our need to be digitally social apple is reportedly close to purchasing the nearly four-year-old path insiders say the deal may already be done too
1558 according to pando daily one well-placed source on apples engineering squad says its almost done if not signed already but its essentially a done deal so why is apple interested in path if they indeed are in a way theyre kindred
1558 path struggles to find users but thats obviously not why they and apple are so similar if anything positive can be said of path its with their design theyve been widely lauded as a heavy-hitter when it comes to ui and experience something apple covets in their own right further evidence of this comes with news that dave morin current path ceo and former apple employee was spotted sitting front and center at apples iphone <number>apple watch event yesterday thats a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners not the ceo if a hit-and-miss social platform apple has no involvement in
1558 apple snapping up path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like morin back in the fold pandos source says path will survive the acquisition whole and be cobbled somehow maybe lightly into apples revamped messaging app
1558 it seems a likely acquisition and it will be interesting to see how apple works path into their fold path is good but suffers the same ghost town moniker that haunts other social platforms like google but hey at least it will probably work out better than apples previous social experiment right
1558 right

1593 the british foreign office told the daily mail it is investigating the accuracy of the reports but is hampered by a lack of presence in syria where isis controls a large swath of territory
1593 the incident occurred last weekend and so we have received the reports in the last few days a spokesman said we dont have any representation inside syria and so it is difficult to confirm these reports
1593 jihadi john was the name given by the media to the masked figure who had a british accent and appeared in the beheading videos of foley sotloff and the british hostages david haines and alan henning in the foley and sotloff videos the knife-wielding terrorist issues a message to america to abandon the airstrikes aimed at isis

1596 according to the officials islamic state terrorists could basically enter the city at will as there is little substantial defense to prevent them from doing so the islamic state are now less than <number>km away from entering baghdad the spokesperson said they said it could never happen and now it almost has us president barack obama says he overestimated what the iraqi army could do the report quoted the spokesperson as saying
1596 obama indeed made that admission sunday night in an interview broadcast on cbs news program <number> minutes over the past couple of years during the chaos of the syrian civil war where essentially you have huge swathes of the country that are completely ungoverned the president said islamic state was able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos
1596 this became ground zero for jihadists around the world obama said of syria where islamic state now controls territory in the east around on the city of raqqa where you ve got states that are failing or in the midst of civil war these kinds of organizations thrive he said
1596 in a separate development over the weekend the head of the syrian al-qaeda-linked al-nusra front said that it would work with islamic state to defeat the western infidels reports said muslims will not watch while their sons are bombed your leaders will not be the only ones who would pay the price of the war you will pay the heaviest price he said warning that the battle would be brought to the hearts of your homes said al-nusra head abu mohamad al-golani you should protect yourselves from this war by standing against the decisions of your rulers and stop them from bringing you the woes of war he added according to reuters
1596 we are in a long war this war will not end in months nor years this war could last for decades group spokesman abu firas al-suri said
1596 it 's not a war against nusra front it 's a war against islam he added

1636 if the bizarre story about joan rivers  doctor pausing to take a selfie in the operating room minutes before the <number>-year-old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on august <number> sounded outlandish that 's because it was so says dr gwen korovin rivers  personal physician who on thursday night shot down a cnn report claiming korovin was so star-struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together

1717 it 's also where she published a post titled suicide note which she had pre-scheduled before her death from the beginning of the note
1717 if you are reading this it means that i have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue
1717 please do n't be sad it 's for the better the life i would ve lived is n't worth living in because i 'm transgender i could go into detail explaining why i feel that way but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is to put it simply i feel like a girl trapped in a boy 's body and i ve felt that way ever since i was <number> i never knew there was a word for that feeling nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl so i never told anyone and i just continued to do traditionally boyish things to try to fit in
1717 when i was <number> i learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness after <number> years of confusion i finally understood who i was i immediately told my mom and she reacted extremely negatively telling me that it was a phase that i would never truly be a girl that god does n't make mistakes that i am wrong if you are reading this parents please do n't tell this to your kids even if you are christian or are against transgender people do n't ever say that to someone especially your kid that wo n't do anything but make them hate them self that 's exactly what it did to me
1717 my mom started taking me to a therapist but would only take me to christian therapists who were all very biased so i never actually got the therapy i needed to cure me of my depression i only got more christians telling me that i was selfish and wrong and that i should look to god for help

1717 after a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college save money for moving out keep my grades up go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything i live for i have decided i ve had enough i 'm never going to transition successfully even when i move out i 'm never going to be happy with the way i look or sound i 'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me i 'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me i 'm never going to find a man who loves me i 'm never going to be happy either i live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or i live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself there 's no winning there 's no way out i 'm sad enough already i do n't need my life to get any worse people say it gets better but that is n't true in my case it gets worse each day i get worse

1723 according to a report from <number>to<number>mac the cupertino company is installing custom-made safes in its apple stores for storing the high-end <number>k gold apple watches
1723 some of the safes are already in place and come with magsafe chargers inside them to ensure the watches remain charged at all times they 'll likely be used to carry both to-be-sold inventory as well as to store demo units from the show floor overnight the tech blog reports
1723 apple is also working on special weight scales for measuring the apple watch this is to stop customers buying the device secretly removing or replacing the gold and then returning it to the store after selling the precious metal on

1723 according to apple ceo tim cook we should expect to see an apple watch launch at some point in april though tester models are already being spotted in the wild
1723 here 's a promotional photo of the gold model
1723 and here 's how it looks on the wrist
1727 apple watch will take approximately two hours to fully charge and deliver all-day battery life with normal on-and-off usage according to techcrunch those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the apple watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge
1727 the report also claims that the apple watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist the smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times apple watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches <number> or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining powerheres a tidbit you might not know in order to receive notifications from apps the watch must be on your wrist and locked they require contact with your skin there will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while its off your wrist push notifications also cease when the battery reaches <number> percent those decisions speak to the care with which apple is handling notificationsapple continues to tweak digital crown on the apple watch giving the button a weightier higher-end feel pressing and holding down the digital crown activates siri which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling directions and commands using a paired iphone the goal of the apple watch the report describes is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go
1727 while both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the apple watch there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device that will change in less than three days when apple provides more details about the apple watch at its highly-anticipated spring forward media event in san francisco the keynote begins on monday at <number> am pacific and macrumors will be providing live coverage of the event

2583 did obamacare work
2583 its worth reflecting upon after president trump and house republicans failed on friday to repeal and replace the disaster of obamacare
2583 ever since the affordable care act was passed in <number> it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate but by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care its possible to hazard some judgments
2583 the answer may vary with your own experience but it ultimately depends on what you value for those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more americans the rational answer should be yes obamacare succeeded more than <number> million americans gained health coverage through the law
2583 continue reading the main story for those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it the rational answer is no obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability health care in the united states remains the most expensive in the world and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many americans
2583 for those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make americans healthier the answer has to be it is too soon to tell
2583 one thing is clear though the affordable care act has shifted the nations baseline expectations for how health care should work its successes have pushed republican politicians like mr trump into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all americans its failures have become focal points too leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals
2583 since republicans took power public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor for lots of people obamacare has become synonymous with the health care system itself with its many miracles and dysfunctions
2583 there are layers beneath each judgment of course the law was broad and complex with many goals and provisions this assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments for many important questions there is not yet strong evidence either way

1823 much has been said already about how the release of the apple watch will be the biggest change in apple products since the company began selling touchscreen devices however apple 's new smartwatch will also bring about a small albeit interesting change to their retail locations the installation of safes not just small personal safes like you may have in your closet but large professional ones like you often see in traditional jewelry stores sources say these forthcoming lockboxes are intended for one thing to store the high-end apple watch edition timepieces that come in luxurious gold
1823 speaking to <number> to <number> mac these sources say that some apple stores are already seeing safe installations take place ahead of the expected april release of the apple watch the safes are expected to be used to securely house the stock of the upscale apple watch models along with the demo units from the floor overnight when the store is closed much like the practice at jewelry retailers
1823 of course any old normal safes would be fit for apple and their premium goods the safes apple stores will be getting are said to be custom-designed and feature installed magsafe chargers for the apple watch which will keep the demo units ready for display the following day
1823 we 're still awaiting an announcement from apple about the pricing of the apple watch the company previously revealed that the base model wearable in aluminum will have a starting price of <number> but the higher end stainless steel and edition models are still anyone 's guess because the edition model is set to feature yellow or rose gold it is expected to be priced at well into the thousands
1823 if apple did n't feel it needed safes before to hold its top of the line computers which already cost several thousands in most cases then it 's probably a good bet that the apple watch edition is going to be their most expensive product
1824 as if women were not subjugated enough already in saudi arabia the nations committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice announced yesterday that tempting eyes would be subject to veils if deemed inappropriate
1824 sheikh motlab al nabet spokesman of the saudi arabian committee said in the announcement that the men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes especially the tempting ones we have the right to do so
1824 the new ban on well-manufactured facial features is broad enough to lead to some inquiry on the definition of tempting eyes moreover what is the process by which a woman will be found guilty of having tempting eyes a humorous image can only come to mind with long lines of tempting eyed women waiting to be brought before the <number>-esque committee
1824 according to an unnamed journalist in saudi arabia tempting eyes could possibly be defined with these stipulations uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup or even without makeup if they are beautiful the woman will be in trouble
1824 the unnamed journalist went onto say it 's so stupid i do n't know what to say they have to stop this many people will oppose this in the country they wo n't be silent
1824 while in most western nations there is harsh divide between church and state in saudi arabia no such segmentation exists in march king abdullah awarded the committee more than <number> million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated <number> to <number> religious police officers which patrol the streets
1824 as king abdullah nears the end of his reign there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow prince naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne but after giving his support to the committee there is little hope that saudi arabia will evolve in the human rights department
1824 the committee is supported by all sides naif said it should be supported because it is a pillar from islam if you are a muslim you should support the committee
1824 the parental because i told you so argument lacks logic and rationale but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule it remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with tempting eyes but if there is a great enough dissenting voices public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy

1872 from a reader in hong kong
1872 i was at the uneventful if tense legco legislative council demonstration on saturday as well as last night 's demonstrations between causeway bay and central
1872 it was as much depressing as ultimately uplifting when i was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray i somehow found myself being reverse crowd-surfed to a safe area
1872 there a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs when they went on to help the next injured person an old woman kept watch over me speaking soft cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks these were complete strangers later when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety when we felt threatened we opened umbrellas and raised our hands
1872 when the police decided to retake the street they sprayed chemicals in our faces pointed rifles at us smashed our limbs with batons while they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon our side threw not one rock not one bottle not one egg nothing none from our side brandished a firearm a knife a club anything at all i have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting burning cars destroying property or intentionally injuring police
1872 young women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls in what other city would tens of thousands of rioters  act with such restraint
1872 the government warned against the chaos occupy central would cause it 's all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity these demonstrations may have been sparked by anger but they 're sustained by compassion and love i have been working around the clock on a non-china-related magazine project as the time of this post indicates and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in hong kong
1872 it is of course interesting to note the spread of the hands-up do n't shoot gesture from ferguson to hong kong but the circumstances in the two places have <number> times more differences than similarities there are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among chinese people namely the movements throughout china in the summer of <number>

1879 pro-democracy protestersput their hands up in the air in fron of the police in hong kong on september <number> <number> alex ogleafpgetty images
1879 while the article did note that its impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to ferguson it concluded contending that its fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in america become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world however it got there
1879 other similar stories followed soon after msnbc published an article monday titled in hong kong protesters say hands up dont shoot the daily mail published a story saying that protesters in hong kong had copied the gesture used by us demonstrators
1879 but a story in quartz sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by hong kong demonstrators was linked to ferguson
1879 according to the story the gesture used by those in hong kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity
1879 most hong kong protesters arent purposefully mimicking hands up dont shootas some have suggested instead the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police
1879 asked about any link between the gesture and ferguson icy ng a <number>-year-old design student at hong kong polytechnic university said i dont think so we have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands ng had not heard of the ferguson protests another demonstrator with the pro-democracy group occupy central ellie ng said the gesture had nothing to do with ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that hong kong protesters are peaceful unarmed and mild a more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas

1892 according to a thread on reddit so take this with a pinch of salt apple ceo tim cook personally requested that the on hold music for people calling customer service be changed and improved after he received an email from an apple user who was disappointed that the quality of the music was so poor tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done the reddit user says
1892 it almost does n't matter whether this story is true or not people will believe it because it dovetails seamlessly with apple 's obsession with detail and quality and the circumstantial evidence leading up the story told in full below is that cook does indeed personally read the email he gets each day from customers i get hundreds and some days thousands of emails from customers this is a privilege because they talk to you as if you 're sitting at their kitchen table he once told nbc according to apple insider
1892 the rap against cook is that while he might be a good ceo he may not be the great visionary ceo that apple needs recently however with apple gearing up to release two large-format iphone <number> models an iwatch wearable device and possibly some sort of push into healthcare or an extension of apple tv 's capabilities cook is looking more and more like the man
1892 part of the case in favor of cook is not that he is a ranting visionary who can rouse the masses like founder steve jobs rather it 's that he 's a super-manager who can make all the different arms of apple 's now-vast empire work together like swiss smartwatch
1892 so the idea that he would reach down into the company 's bowels to tweak the way the on-hold muzak sounds when people call up for help sounds exactly like something this super-manager would do
1892 here 's what reddit user lerde wrote
1892 i once sent tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with apple it was super low quality therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because i was on hold for <number> minutes for something so simple iphone did n't turn on needed to set up a repair as in my country no apple store have to send it to another country
1892 much to my surprise a lady from cupertino called me up the next day saying she 'd received a concerning email from tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone that tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done she assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections
1892 the next time i called apple the hold music was indeed very pleasant

1977 britain said on saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a british national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by islamic state had been wounded in a us-led air strike last week
1977 the man dubbed jihadi john by the british media was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of is leaders in an iraqi town close to the syrian border last saturday britain 's mail on sunday newspaper reported
1977 the group 's leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was also said to have been wounded in the attack the paper added
1977 we are aware of reports a british foreign office spokeswoman said we can not confirm these reports
1977 a speech purporting to be by baghdadi was released on thursday following contradictory accounts out of iraq that he had been wounded last friday in us air strikes
1977 us officials said on tuesday they could not confirm whether baghdadi was hit in a strike near falluja in iraq
1977 according to the mail on sunday which said its source was an unnamed nurse jihadi john baghdadi and other wounded is figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the syrian city of raqqa

1980 for its iphone <number> and <number> plus follow-up expected to debut in <number> apple may introduce a handset with dual lenses in what one well-connected apple pundit calls the biggest camera jump ever
1980 on the most recent episode of the talk show podcast daring fireball 's john gruber revealed that a birdie of a birdie told him apple is working on a two-lens system for incorporation in the next-generation iphone
1980 the specific thing i heard is that next year 's camera might be the biggest camera jump ever gruber said i do n't even know what sense this makes but i ve heard that it 's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into dslr quality imagery
1980 the notion of using multi-lens imaging systems to make up for a smartphone 's small form factor is a relatively recent development in march htc unveiled the one m<number> with a so-called duo camera setup which uses a secondary imaging sensor for depth data
1980 an interesting startup called corephotonics which was profiled by engadget earlier this year proposes a different approach corephotonics developed a dual-lens module with two distinct focal lengths effectively negating resolution drops associated with digital zooming one camera is used for wide shots while the other is used for close-ups as an added bonus the system provides spatial data for <number>d imagery due to its lens offset
1980 while speculation apple could employ a similar system or even stitch together image data from both camera modules to achieve dslr-quality high-resolution photos the company has no shortage of patents covering smartphone camera technology including lytro-like refocusing interchangeable modules and interchangeable external lenses
1980 perhaps most similar to today 's rumor is an invention for a multi-sensor system that gathers luminance and chrominance values separately processes the data and outputs photos at exceptionally high resolutions with equally high color accuracy

2038 the health-focused smartwatch that apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month according to a new report
2038 apple 's original concept for the apple watch was one that would track blood pressure heart activity stress levels and other functions the wall street journal reported monday citing sources familiar with the device but none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues according to the journal some features did n't work properly others proved too complex and some would have required regulatory approval as such apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena the sources said
2038 due out in april the apple watch will enter an already crowded playing field competing with products from samsung sony motorola microsoft lg and others it 's been thought that apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features but if the journal 's sources are correct some of those features proved more challenging than expected
2038 for example the journal reported apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate but the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people such as those with hairy arms or dry skin and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch according to the journal 's sources
2038 apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood but again the results were inconsistent further if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice they would have required approval from the food and drug administration  something apple was trying to avoid
2038 the difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at apple to dub the project a black hole as it sucked in more and more resources one of the sources said
2038 as a result apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable yes several key health and fitness features will be available and useful especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market but apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch including its variety of styles its ability to act as an adjunct to the iphone its support for apple pay and its voice-activated controls
2038 will those features and the apple name convince enough consumers to consider the apple watch over the competition in december piper jaffray analyst gene munster projected unit sales of <number> million for <number> wall street has been forecasting sales of <number> million to <number> million apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture <number> million to <number> million watches for its first quarter of release
2038 whether initial sales are as healthy as expected apple will certainly come out with future models those could even include some of the health features that did n't pass muster the first time around the journal 's sources added
